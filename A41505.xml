            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SOme time ago came out a Pamphlet called <hi>A fair Character of the Presbyterian Reformlings juſt and ſober Vindication of his Obſervations upon the</hi> 30th. <hi>of</hi> January <hi>and</hi> 29th. <hi>of</hi> May, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein the Author, who cannot deny himſelf, inſtead of arguing in a fair way, doth after his uſual manner, continue in his Nonſence, and giving ill Language: We looking upon that barren Soul of his to be like the Earth ſpoken of in Scripture, <hi>Heb. 6.8. which beareth Thorns and Briers,</hi> and nothing elſe, to condeſcend to that Narrowneſs of his, do now afford him ample matter, and a large Field, which we never intended to have done, if in his ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling he had given but an indifferent Satisfaction; but in caſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he doth mend, we ingage fairly to reply to any reaſonable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he happeneth to give the following Papers, and therein alſo to take notice of the forementioned Pamphlet, though it be not worth it in the least, which to demonſtrate I now by the by ſhall produce three or four Instances upon ſeveral Heads, to the end, that they which know not his way may be informed of the Nature of the Tree by his Fruit.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing obvious is out of his Preface, and that's his fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notions and like Expreſſions about <hi>Ray the Mad-man</hi> (for Men of the ſame Kidney are well acquainted one with another) <hi>to haire it about Town without his Cravat on, or the Court Baux, to air in the Park without a Steinkirk twiſted Poſt Neckcloth,</hi> and this attended with a <hi>Juſt ſo perhaps for the Compleat Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> &amp;c. Who can forbear applauding unto and admiring at theſe high and noble Notions, fit and proper Expreſſions for a Divine, and
<pb facs="tcp:41736:3"/>in matters of this Nature, ſo well compacted and handſomly coherent one with another? Surely the Man muſt need be in love with his own Wit, and a great Admirer of himſelf; ſo let him be for me, who have not been at School with him at <hi>Bedlam,</hi> nor pretend to ſuch an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible Stock of Nonſence as we find him to be poſſeſſed of, as his whole Pamphlet doth evince and demonſtrate, after reading whereof no Doctor, though but of indifferent Skill, can deny ſuch an one to want a pretty ſtrong Doſe of <hi>Hellebore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! Poor Man, he is much to be pitied, but not at all to be envied, like a weak ſilly Knat, ſticks at a ſlight Cobweb: What a fooliſh ado is there with him about a Miſtake in the Printer, for miſquoting a Text of Scripture in the Title Page, where <hi>John</hi> is put for <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which if he had pleaſed, he might have found rectified in the Margin of my Page <hi>44.</hi> One that inſiſts ſo much upon ſuch things, as about it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the greateſt Part of his <hi>Page 3.</hi> muſt needs have little elſe to ſay. But a drowning Man lays hold on and catches at any thing in his way.</p>
            <p>The Bottom of that Man's Spirit againſt <hi>Reformers</hi> and <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> doth more and more appear, for concerning it he hath ſpoken not only againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> pag. <hi>25, 26.</hi> but alſo falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Luther,</hi> whoſe <hi>Reformation</hi> he calls a <hi>Combuſtion in</hi> Germany <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion,</hi> pag. <hi>27. and to be ingenuous,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was ſet on foot through Intereſt and a Pique,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the loſs of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Intereſt more than a Religious Diſlike, moved him to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with Indulgences:</hi> About this he fills up almoſt two of his Pages, from the latter end of <hi>Pag. 23.</hi> till the Middle of pag. <hi>25.</hi> Where he uſeth theſe Expreſſions, <hi>which in my ſence ſmells ſomething of Intereſt:</hi> This he borrowed from <hi>Papiſts</hi> who ſaid it long before him. But what can be expected from a Man who ſeems to make no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and that worthy Martyr <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> whom in his firſt Page he puts together, and in the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegory or Predicament.</p>
            <p>How pitifully doth he come off in his page <hi>25.</hi> about what I ſaid concerning bowing at or towards the Altar in my pag. <hi>49, 50, &amp;c.</hi> wherein he gives a ſtrong Proof of his Learning, as page <hi>27.</hi> he doth of his great Judgment, when he ſaith, <hi>the Reformer is angry that I
<pb facs="tcp:41736:3"/>do not prove every thing out of Scripture, what will become of the Parliament and</hi> Weſtminſter Hall, <hi>if we cannot find them in the Bible?</hi> The Queſtion is about matters of Divine Worſhip, which I ſuppoſe he will own to be a Point of Religion, whereof Scripture is the Rule, how then doth he bring in over Head and Shoulders the Parliament and <hi>Weſtminſter Hall?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would think he hath chiefly conſulted how to promote the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller's, and may be, his own Intereſt with turning the half of his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet into a kind of ſilly Play, not to inſtruct, but if poſſible to delight the Reader, to make it ſell the better, for generally, now is a better Market for comical than for ſerious things: But he muſt needs find himſelf much miſtaken, for his Jeſts are inſipid, and if ever he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by aimed at Gain or Credit, he is fallen very ſhort of his Expectation, but I find the Fool of the Play is the Part he hath taken upon him to act on this Stage, as his <hi>Enter Obſervator</hi> pag. <hi>17.</hi> and <hi>Exit,</hi> with <hi>Enter</hi> Reformling, pag. <hi>22.</hi> do declare.</p>
            <p>Out of theſe few Inſtances the Reader may judge I deal againſt no dangerous Antagoniſt, and ſo it will be no hard Work for me upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to anſwer his Libel or Pamphlet, it will be much eaſier for me to do't, than for him to excuſe or vindicate the ſeditious, nay, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Expreſſions in ſome of the Sermons preached on theſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Days, ſuch as on the laſt <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> we beard in the Chapel of <hi>Chelſey</hi> College, where one having in the Pulpit quoted <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and ſcrewed Paſſive Obedience to the Height, ſaid, <hi>The Sin of putting King</hi> Charles <hi>to death, is in ſome reſpect worſe than that of the Jews for crucifying our Saviour, for the Jews never owned Jeſus Chriſt to be their King,</hi> ſuch Compariſons are odious and very unbecoming, for they run not only between the Acts, but alſo between the Sufferers.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be wiſhed theſe matters were laid aſide, ſpecially now when there is an Act of Indulgence, and every one ſhould be ſatisfied to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his own way, but 'tis ſad to ſee theſe things to be revived every Year, or almoſt every Day, and this in a bitter and uncharitable way. But indeed being th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s provoked we can't and muſt not forſake our Cauſe, and be mute when called Factions, Schiſmaticks, Enemies to all Order in Church and State, 'tis but reaſonable and neceſſary for us to
<pb facs="tcp:41736:4"/>let the World know we are no ſuch Men acted by meer Fancy, and Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as miſrepreſented, and to give our Reaſons why we cannot conſent and conform. May the Lord out of his infinite wiſdom and mercy, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his due time to unite us in judgment and affection for the truth.</p>
            <p>Now ſomething alſo must be added as to the ſubject matter of the following Papers: We have Cauſe to thank God that ſince our late happy Revolution the Yoke of Perſecution is broke off from our Neck, and we now enjoy the Liberty of meeting pulickly to ſerve God, and are ſecured by an Act of Parliament which I pray God may last for ever, except it were taken off upon a better account, namely, to unite us all voluntarily to joyn together in the Worſhip of God: Wherefore many things as are ſaid in this Paper must be underſtood according as things were when the Laws were ſtrict and ſeverely put in Execution againſt us, and not ſince the Time of Indulgence, but in relation to Laws it ought to be taken notice of, how the Penal Laws which at firſt were intended only againſt Popiſh Recuſants, were thorough the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Craftineſs of ſome Men willing to keep up Diviſions, fully turned againſt us, as we may believe, contrary to the Intention of the Makers thereof. I deſire what I ſay in this ſhort Treatiſe may be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as ariſing (as indeed it doth) out of a Principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Peace grounded upon Truth, for without it they can never ſtand long, nor be acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>Now I deſire thoſe who are concerned in theſe matters to conſider the Neceſſity of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion by the Greatneſs of the Danger which the Want of it, doth conſtantly expoſe us to from our common Enemy, doth not former and latter Experience convince us of this Truth? And were we not very lately like to have been all ſwallowed up by Papiſts, when not thinking themſelves ſtrong enough at home, they combined with forreign Powers to bring it about? They have too well learned the Maxim <hi>divide &amp; impera,</hi> and therefore all our Diviſions were ever fomented by them ſtriving to ſet us together by the Ears, with one Party to ruin another, and at laſt to deſtroy us both, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Glory of God, if there was no other Reaſon but Self-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we ought to be convinced of the Neceſſity of labouring to come to a Reconciliation, and doth not Experience ſufficiently teach us how theſe Matters ever have been the Occaſion of Differences in Church and
<pb facs="tcp:41736:4"/>State. Out of what hath been ſaid, I lay this for a Foundation, that it is our common Intereſt, and for the Preſervation of us all, there is a Neceſſity to agree and unite.</p>
            <p>Now it is undeniably true that theſe Matters have been the Cauſes of our Diviſions, the partition Wall which hath kept us aſunder, and that this maintains ſtill the Papiſt Intereſt amongst us, which would preſently fall down if that Door was ſhut upon them: As to the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Part of the <hi>39</hi> Articles we are all agreed, and as to Church. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the general we unite thus far, that there ought to be a Diſcipline with a Miniſtery by way of Office, and that none ought to take care of Souls and administer God's Ordinances, but theſe who have a lawful Call to it; we agree or ought to agree how the Word of God and Apostolical Practice therein contained, muſt be the Rule of Doctrine and Worſhip: when afterward we come to differ, why ſhould we not be judged by that Law (which is the Word of an infallible God) preferrably to the Judgment of any Man, or of all Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who are all ſubject to Error? And why upon this Difference ſhould the ſtrongeſt go about cutting the Throat of the weakeſt, as good as to ſay, I cannot perſwade you, but will force you; a good Cauſe, as we ſay to Papiſts, muſt never be promoted by ſuch evil means, for it cannot be denied but a great deal of Violence hath been therein uſed againſt Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>Men who cannot agree amongſt themſelves, muſt about a Judge. Now Infallibility and Impartiality the two neceſſary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications for a juſt Judge, are not to be had but in the Word of God, which is not wanting in giving us Directions for the Well-being as for the Being of the Church, or elſe it were imperfect: <hi>All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect.</hi> Where Perfection is, nothing is wanting <hi>to make us wife unto Salvation, 2</hi> Tim. <hi>3.15, 16, 17.</hi> We ſay it is againſt our Conſcience to do the things they would have us to do; they cannot ſay it is againſt theirs to leave them: I do not ſpeak to one ſingle Perſon, who for his Excuſe will pretend they are commanded him, but I ſpeak to the Law Makers. Now, is there not more Reaſon for you to leave them off which doth not wound
<pb facs="tcp:41736:5"/>your Conſcience than for us to do them, and thereby offend ours? Why do you impoſe ſuch Neceſſity, ſuch Oaths, ſuch Subſcriptions as you do, which are or become meer Snares, contrary to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule? <hi>This I ſpeak for your own Profit, not that I may caſt a Snare upon you, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>7.35.</hi> which Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> calls <hi>Aureus locus liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis vindex, a golden Text Aſſerter of Liberty.</hi>

            <p>The Queſtion is about Ceremonies, religious in their Nature, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and Signification, which we ſay ought not to be brought into the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God without a Warrant from the Word, the Rule of it; and I doubt what <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Bald win</hi> do expreſs is too true; it is not to be doubted but that moſt of the antient Biſhops were ſomewhat too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in deviſing Rites,—but unhappy was their Counſel: I ſuppoſe they had been inſtituted for a good End, yet being abuſed, they are taken away for a better. Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> ſpeaks much in few Words, Rejoynder to <hi>Martial,</hi> Art. <hi>1. The Gates of Hell,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>aſſaulted the Church in idle Ceremonies, the Fathers in them declined from the Simplicity of the Goſpel.</hi> Bellarmin de eff. ſacr. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>32.</hi> can condemn vain and unprofitable Ceremonies. <hi>Lyra,</hi> another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt ſaith, the Memory of Idolatry is totally to be wiped out, and the Jeſuit <hi>Coſter,</hi> Enchir. chap. <hi>8.</hi> confeſſeth, that if the Subſtance of Bread remain in the Sacrament, then their Idolatry is more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the Egyptians was in worſhipping of an Ox or a Crocodile; they agree as to the Point, but when we juſtly come to apply it, then they will not hear of it, they will aſſert a Tranſubſtantiation before they will own an Idolatry worſe than that of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or that their Ceremonies are vain, unprofitable, and Idolatrous, and yet we are ſatisfied they are ſo, though ſome of our Church would qualifie things, and ſay, they are not ſo idolatrous as the Heathenists, and all this to what purpoſe? Only to make ours, which we have from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, not to be ſo bad as thoſe very ſame which ſtill are in Popery, thus to defend our own, we are more engaged in the Defence of theirs, over Head and Ears.</p>
            <p>No doubt but that Place I already mentioned, <hi>1 Cor. 2.23.</hi> is, as <hi>Beza</hi> well noteth, to be underſtood of Superſtition, which ſome fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call indifferent things; ſo are our Ceremonies, yet how can they be indifferent when joyned to God's Worſhip, and though Practice made
<pb facs="tcp:41736:5"/>ſo inſeparable a Part of it, that one ſhall be refuſed the Ordinance if he will not take the Ceremony with it; now we have a learned Author, <hi>Daneus,</hi> who maketh it Blaſphemy to think and teach that any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things of Human Institution may be made a Sign in the Church of ſpiritual things, becauſe indeed 'tis to make of them a kind of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which none but Chriſt may inſtitute without Blaſphemy. What is it that made our Saviour ſpeak ſo much againſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> though <hi>Moſes</hi> had dreadfully threatned not to add any thing, yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Innovations have been brought in; as for an Inſtance their Waſhings, wherein the Addition first is condemned, then our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our blameth the Superſtition becauſe the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were not ſatisfied to have made Additions contrary to the Precept, but further in theſe Additions or Waſhings they placed ſomething of Religious Worſhip, and laſt of all they were ſo fond of theſe Additions, that they ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and preſſed their Obſervation more than of that Worſhip which God himſelf had inſtituted, and I leave it to the Judgment of any impartial Man, whether or not theſe three things are not viſibly to be found in our Ceremonies? Namely, firſt, The Addition or the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; ſecondly, The Superſtition placing therein a Religious and Spiritual Signification; Thirdly, preſſing theſe Ceremonies more than God's Inſtitutions, ſo that the ſame Cenſure which our Saviour paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for theirs, may be paſſed upon us for ours, with the ſame Reaſon for both, which he gives upon that Occaſion, and in that Place, <hi>Every Plant which my Heavenly Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted out,</hi> Matth. <hi>15.</hi> from <hi>v. 2.</hi> till <hi>14.</hi> After God's Inſtitution came ſuch Teachers who did not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſe enough till they had patched ſomething of their own to the Word of God, yet no Addition to that Word is tolerable, to invent new Waſhings was an idle Vanity: Had they reſted in the Law of God, their Modeſty would have been more pleaſing to him than their Forwardneſs in doing otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Let us aſſure our ſelves we ſhall ever be unruly and wild-headed, there ſhall be no End to our Fancy, our Imagination ſhall be bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs until the Lord hath fixed us, and made us ſettle upon and ſtick to this Ground, that it is no more lawful for us in any wiſe to add any thing to his Law, than it is lawful for us to take any thing from
<pb facs="tcp:41736:6"/>it. Therefore it is better for Men at laſt to leave off the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have too long continued, to aboliſh thoſe which have cauſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Troubles, Animoſities, Perſecutions, given Encouragement to prophane Perſons, and Advantage over us to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and have been amongſt us a kind of accurſed thing, for God's Bleſſig never goes along with thoſe Inventions of Man's Brains, as are brought into his Worſhip, his Word and Experience we have for it. I ſay 'tis better to aboliſh all ſuch things which in themſelves may be called meer Fopperies rather than to fence for them, in as much as we would do for the Goſpel, and to be as loth to part with them as with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, and with true Religion: Let not Men therefore ſet all their Wits at Work to ſcrue ſomething here and there to defend theſe, but rather to promote the Glory of God, the Good of his Church, the Salvation of Souls, and the Edification of all our Neighbours, and to be for and own the Truth.</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE ABOUT CEREMONIES, Church-Government and Liturgy.</head>
            <p>COmpariſons are odious, is a common ſaying, and true upon ſeveral accounts; as when ſome pretend to advantages and priviledges above others, as may be to more Parts, Learning, or to be Wiſer, Greater, or Better: Which laſt is the caſe of our National Church, by ſome of the Members called the beſt Proteſtant Church, I ſhall not ſay the beſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> (for we have ſome who love the name no more than the thing) of any other whatſoever beyond Sea: when 'tis not modeſty to be ſo poſitive in our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, and ſo magiſterially to decide in our own caſe to the prejudice of others. The inſtruments of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation amongſt us, were good, pious and learned, but not infallible men, which they did not pretend to; they did their beſt as God enabled them, and wherein they followed his Word for their Rule, they did admirably well, but not ſo in ſome things about which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with their own Wiſdom, and wherein they were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41736:7"/>guided by humane and worldly conſiderations; for hereupon they all did not agree, there being thoſe who were for being wholly and only directed by the word, and not biaſſed by any Worldly Policy.</p>
            <p>Our Church was certainly well Reformed in the main points of Doctrine, and in the groſſeſt Superſtitions of Popery: I ſay it was before Semipelagianiſm, or Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm, had infected many of her Members, though the Doctrine, as then received, ſtill remaineth ſound: but in regard of ſome Ceremonies and of Eccleſiaſtical Government, 'tis not-the-beſt Reformed Church, ſeeing it doth ſtill retain ſome Corruptions and Abuſes of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> which are unprofitable, inconvenient, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hurtful, and therefore ought to be removed; for if thoſe Ceremonies that were of God's own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were <hi>diſannulled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7.18.</note> much more ought thoſe to be taken off for the ſame reaſon, that are of Man's Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which never were good (becauſe part of Will-Worſhip) as others were: but abuſe is a ſufficient ground to have them laid aſide,<note place="margin">2 King. 18.4.</note> as was the <hi>braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;</hi> and if we are to anſwer for every idle word, much more for every idle Ceremony, which may happen to prove a deſtructive Snare to many Souls; in matters of Worſhip as in others, 'tis not enough to teach the truth, but alſo it muſt be truly taught, and that's only out of God's Word, which is to be the Rule of Worſhip and Diſcipline as of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>As the infirmity of Men newly converted from <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> did bring into Chriſtian Churches Cuſtoms like unto thoſe uſed amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo our Men newly come out of Popery, kept ſeveral Popiſh Ceremonies and Superſtitions out of natural propenſity in many to Superſtition: Of old, <hi>Eaſter</hi> brought in a ſuperſtitious <hi>Lent,</hi> to attend upon't, made Baptiſm wait for their Moon, and conformed our Lord's Supper to the Jewiſh Paſſover with unleavened Bread; ſo amongſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41736:7"/>us are ſuperſtitiouſly retained Popiſh Rites, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I ſhall ſpeak of in particular by God's Grace. Would to God we would here follow good advice, (and not give way to a prejudice againſt adviſers) as in the beginning of Reformation it was done in <hi>Suitzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> when <hi>Anabaptists</hi> there oppoſed humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as unlawful, by publick Authority and common Conſent they were aboliſhed, and Thanks given them for the Advice, becauſe the thing was reaſonable, by thoſe who in other things were their Adverſaries: ſo ours ought to be removed, becauſe they train up the People of God in ſubjecting themſelves in the Worſhip of God, uuto the pleaſure of Men, they make way for groſs Superſtitions, as Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they challenge to themſelves that which is proper to God's Ordinances, which doth offend many in and out of the Church, and encourage Popery; yet for theſe Ceremonies they ſtand as ſtiffly as <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his <hi>Epheſians</hi> did for their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> and do not care how they diſturb the Peace, not only of one City, but of the whole World beſides, right or wrong they defend them, and make a point of Honour of it more than to ſeek after, to find, and own the Truth when found; though they would ſay 'tis our Oppoſition to theſe Ceremonies, that is the Cauſe of the Miſchief ariſing therefrom, but that is no more the cauſe of it, than the meſſages of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> were the Cauſes of his Cruelty againſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The Ceremonies are unjuſt and unlawful, as by the Grace of God we ſhall make it appear, impoſing of them is that which breaks the Peace of the Church, which conſiſteth in avoiding to give Scandal: Lay aſide ſuch Humane Ceremonies which are the ground of Diſputes, and you take away the Cauſe of Offence; which to give is a kind of Murther; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls this,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.15.</note> 
               <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy:</hi> This is to prefer Diviſion before Peace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo to give Popery an inlet upon us, and hindereth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41736:8"/>us from <hi>being like-minded one towards another,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 15 5, 6.</note> and from <hi>glorifying God with one mind, and one mouth,</hi> which is no ſmall ſin: And I wiſh there be not too much of ſelf worldly end in the caſe, namely, to keep out of the Church thoſe who by means of their laborious and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preaching, might have many followers, and do Souls more good than others, and ſo exclude them from Church Benefices, and Preferments; which they are willing to appropriate wholly to themſelves. Indeed it looks too much that way.</p>
            <p>Ceremonies introduced into God's Worſhip, are a palpable breach of the Second Commandment, wherein Will-worſhip is expreſly forbidden, as all external Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, all Rites and Ceremonies of Man's deviſing in God's Worſhip. Now the Ceremonies in queſtion are Will-worſhip, and not the leaſt ſtep for them in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet to make them lawful they muſt be warranted by the Word; which not being, they muſt own that whatſoever is beſides the Word is againſt the Word: Now thoſe in queſtion are ſignificant; and teaching Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of Man's invention ſtated in God's Worſhip, and an addition, expreſly againſt the Rule of the Word, and I think the dreadful threatnings againſt thoſe that do ſo, as expreſſed <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. ſhould make any Man's Ears to tingle, and his Heart to tremble. Then they are Man's Inventions, and have been and are <hi>Popiſh</hi> Idols, whereby they make a Conformity between us and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters in God's Worſhip, and are Occaſions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Evil: In a word, they are the <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> and <hi>garments ſpotted with the fleſh:</hi> Why then ſhould we not with <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſay, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.8.</note> God hath taught us as formerly he did his People,<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.20.</note> to <hi>defile the covering of Images, to caſt them away as a menſtruous Cloth, and ſay unto it, get thee hence.</hi> Now whatſoever is brought in without God's Appointment, is an Idol of Jealouſie in his ſight.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41736:8"/>
            <p>Civil Governours may according to the Conſtitution of their Government make new Laws, but in God's Worſhip it may not be ſo; 'tis not under their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, only they are to ſee God's Laws put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: All their Humane Inventions are as many Snares to deſtroy, to adulterate the Worſhip of the Lord, and to ſtrip him of his Right, who is the only Law-giver. And the Tyranny of thoſe that impoſe ſuch things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the Laws of other Tyrants, becauſe they Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniſe over the Conſcience: Beſides that this is contrary to the ſufficiency and perfection of Scriptures, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Chriſtians Condition worſe, and leſs tolerable than that of the Jews; for their Ceremonies were impoſed of God, and there was but a certain number of them; but as to ours, though they be not many, yet 'tis in their power to bring in what they pleaſe. Theirs were God's Ordinances, ours are the Traditions of Men; and yet theirs are aboliſhed: So that in ſuch things from the power of God, we paſs under that of Men, and thereby become their Servants, which ought not to be, for we are Chriſt's Servants by purchaſe; and that very reaſon <hi>Paul</hi> giveth, <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>be ye not the Servants of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thoſe Rites did ceaſe by which God himſelf did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the World, as we ſaid before, it is an imprudent part to preſs others in their place; in the purer times they appointed no Ceremonies, but were content with that pure and ſimple Form that God had commanded. One in his Work called <hi>Verbum abbreviatum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Petrus pariſien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</note> doth relate how one <hi>Arnulphus</hi> in a Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> where they were about to make new Ceremonies, ſaid to them, ye ought rather to take away the old ones, which are a burthen to Chriſtians: Now they muſt not ſay ours are but few, and theirs were many; for, though not in the ſame degree, yet few are a burthen as well as many; and in the beginning of our Reformation, in his Cenſure
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41736:9"/>of the Engliſh Liturgy,<note place="margin">Page 458.</note> 
               <hi>Bucer</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is fit that in all outward things and actions of God's Worſhip, as in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Garments, we ſhould accommodate our ſelves to the ſimplicity of Chriſt's Appointment and Apoſtles Practice; and we ſhould,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>witneſs to all Men that we have no Communion with the Relicks of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Antichriſt: But our Teachers ſhould teach, and we ſhould hear only that which Chriſt hath commanded, Matth.</hi> 10. and <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>Quaeritis quomodo Vincuntur pagani,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, Ye ask how Pagans may be overcome? deſerite eorum ritus,</hi> the way is to leave off their Ceremonies, and that ſame conſideration made <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſo ſteddy, that he would not endure Bays and Ivy at the Doors of Chriſtians whom he forbideth to uſe any of their Cuſtoms; ſo we may ſay, will ye overcome and convince Papiſts, caſt away their Ceremonies; for let us not deceive our ſelves, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as well Popiſh, Heatheniſh and Jewiſh we ought to part with. As for inſtance, if to avoid the Jews Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> our Altars or Communion-Tables are towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> then we ſhall fall into the practice of the Idolatry of the Heathens, who Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> whereof God takes notice, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.16. the way to avoid theſe two, or any other extream, is to have no certain affected place, but only that which is moſt convenient.</p>
            <p>But before we come to particulars, we muſt ſpeak ſomething more of Ceremonies in general, there are ſuch Circumſtances and Ceremonies, without which nothing can be done in any Society, whether Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Civil, as Times, Places and Perſons; but both theſe do not come within the queſtion, nor thoſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind as are derived from Scripture, ſuch are Kneeling in the ſolemn Duty of Prayer, and breaking Bread in the Lord's Supper, which be neceſſary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, nor thoſe that are truly and only for Decency and Order, which anon we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41736:9"/>of: but the Diſpute is of Rites not commanded by God but deviſed by Man; unneceſſary in the Church, yet are preſſed as neceſſary, though by them owned to be indifferent, and are uſed as analogically Sacramental as well as properly Moral, and in their ſignification they make them partake to the nature of Sacraments; alſo in their ſignificative teaching and ſtirring up of the Heart, and being uſed in Worſhip as external Acts of God's Worſhip falſly appointed by Men, and ſerve not for Order, Decency, nor Edification. In the Preface of the Common Prayer Book, diſcovering the intent of the Impoſers, are theſe words concerning Ceremonies; <hi>Such are retained which are apt to ſtir the dull mind of Man to the remembrance of his Duty to God, by ſome moral and ſpecial ſignification, whereby he might be edified.</hi> To this may be applied that complaint of God againſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 29.13.</note> 
               <hi>Their fear towards me is taught by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay, they make not our Ceremonies neceſſary to Salvation, no more do Papiſts theirs; for, ſay they, 'tis by the Church's Inſtitution, yet they make it ſin to omit them out of the caſe of Scandal and Contempt; and our Church Men ſay no leſs, I am ſure their practiſe ſaith ſo much; for they puniſh Men for not practiſing them, and they make them as neceſſary to Salvation as Men can make them, when the ordinary means are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely denied to all thoſe that refuſe them: Papiſts own many or moſt of their Ceremonies to be Humane, becauſe inſtituted by Men, as their ſeveral Garments in the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis very ſtrange indeed, that when we preſs our Ceremoniſts to lay aſide ſo many idle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions about Humane, unneceſſary, inſignificant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, that have been and are abuſed to Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Idolatry, and ſo may not lawfully be uſed and impoſed upon Chriſt's Church and People, they take up the Cudgels for Popery, ſaying, their Idolatry and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41736:10"/>the Pagan's conſidered in themſelves not to be alike; and we ſay, though Popiſh Images be not the ſame as thoſe of the Heathens, yet they are as abominable Idols as theirs, and the Worſhipping of them as much to be abhorred by all true Chriſtians, as the Worſhipping of the Images of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> The wiſeſt ſort of Heathens knew well there is but one true God, Maker of all things; but the ignorant and rudeſt ſort of Papiſts, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Creature more devoutly, as Divine Objects, than thoſe Heathens were uſed to do: They who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed amongſt them, may ſpeak of this according to their certain knowledge; and this I muſt add, how therein Papiſts ſin againſt greater Light than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Beſides, is there among the Heathens any worſe or ſo bad an Idolatry as that of the <hi>Maſs?</hi> Heathens Worſhipped pretty Figures finely wrought by cunning Workmen; but Papiſts worſhip a Wafer, which any Dunce can make, nothing commendable either for Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Workmanſhip.</p>
            <p>Now the Ceremonies in queſtion having undeniably been derived to us from Popery, we ought to abhor them; for ſurely Chriſt hath not left his chaſte Spouſe ſo bare and naked, as to need borrowing Garments from the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Our holy Religion is pure, why then ſhould it be defiled with the pollutions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church?

They make a pother, and keep a noiſe for they do not know what; and are not able to give any good grounds for, only out of an implicite Faith, and 'tis the practiſe of the Church, 'tis by Law Eſtabliſhed. This was the very ſame Argument by the Jews in <hi>Corinth</hi> uſed againſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 18.13.</note> 
               <hi>This Fellow perſwadeth Men to Worſhip God contrary to the Law;</hi> that of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, which in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Conſcience, ought at that time to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded more than now any meerly Humane Laws, but they were in the wrong; ſo are our Advocates for Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, when they ought to know, that diſcreetly to interpret Humane Precepts in the Court of Conſcience, doth belong to every one as touching his own practice, and this ignorance is not only far ſpread amongſt the Lay-men, who might take pains to be informed of cauſes and reaſons of things, and not ſuffer themſelves before that to receive impreſſions for, or prejudices againſt perſons and things, but alſo 'tis crept amongſt ſome of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41736:11"/>the Clergy, who adhere to ſuch things only by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Cuſtom, though on the other ſide I know ſome of them ſtudy hardly any thing elſe, but thoſe points wherein they make Religion conſiſt more, than in the knowledge of our Lord Chriſt crucified.</p>
            <p>It is Humane to ſin, as 'tis Deviliſh to continue in ſin; but 'tis a Divine thing to raiſe from ſin: the firſt becauſe no ſingle Man or any Society is infallible; therefore 'tis not good to preſs Preſidents in that caſe; for we muſt live and do according to Rules, and not according to Examples; ſo that it is no wonder to ſee Men in a wrong way; but 'tis of the Devil for them to perſevere, and go on in the ſame; for he engageth Men deeper and deeper in the Mire, ſo as to make it impoſſible for them to come off; and when they are in ſo deſperate a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nothing but Divine Grace can bring them out; which is done with opening the eyes to ſee how one is in a wrong way, and make him willing and able to come off. More Men are deceived by Satan under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Devotion and Religious Worſhip, than with open Impiety and Atheiſm; becauſe as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.23.</note> 
               <hi>thoſe have indeed a ſhew of Wiſdom in Will-worſhip and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:</hi> But let Men have a care, for there is a Snare in it, which they, except God openeth their Eyes, cannot perceive; for in thoſe <hi>in whom the Goſpel Truths are hid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>the God, of this World hath blinded the minds.</hi> At the beginning things appear ſmall; 'tis a harmleſs Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which can do no hurt, ſome ſay, but that one or many, may in time happen to degenerate into Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idolatry: The Brazen Serpent was a good thing, yet we know how far the Devil did prevail upon People to commit Idolatry about it. And what would not they have done about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if God had not been pleaſed to take care to prevent it with conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from them, either burying it in an unknown place, or about, or after his Death, transforming it from a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41736:12"/>mortal into an immortal Body,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.17.</note> as thoſe that <hi>are alive ſhall be caught up:</hi> We know what is written about his Death,<note place="margin">Deut. 34.6.</note> but alſo we read how <hi>Moſes</hi> with <hi>Elias</hi> appeared unto our Saviour in the Transfiguration; which I take to be true <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> was true <hi>Elias;</hi> but this only by the by. Thus to return to my Subject, to prevent Dangers and Miſchiefs, the beſt is, never to hearken to ſuch ſuggeſtions; and admit into the Worſhip of God nothing that can be, and is abuſed to Superſtition and Idolatry, as ſome of our Ceremonies are by Papiſts, if not by ſome of us.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Ceremonies are unprofitable; for God is not better ſerved with then without them; and we ſee nothing they contribute towards Order, Decency, or Edification,, which are the three things they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they are profitable for. The Churches that have them not want them not; for without them they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Order, Decency, and Edification. In matters of Worſhip nothing is profitable but what is of God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; for God knows beſt what may do his Church good; and he doth bleſs only his Ordinances and not Man's Inventions. Nothing can be aſſigned that ever was introduced into the Worſhip by Man's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that produced a good effect: Nay, I will ſay, that though for the preſent, and after the immediate Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing, there appeared ſome good to come out of it, yet afterwards it hath produced great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and miſchiefs; for if ſometimes God ſuffereth his own Ordinances to be abuſed by Men, much more ſhall Humane Devices be corrupted: Being unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they become unneceſſary and ſuperfluous, a yoke and a burthen; let Men give them what ſpecious Names they pleaſe, the queſtion is not what things may be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but what they are in their Nature; for if ſome of the Ceremonies in queſtion may be called Holy, becauſe uſed in an Holy Action, ſo may a Cuſhion uſed in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41736:12"/>Holy Act of Prayer: but inſtituted ſignificant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies muſt have another kind of Holineſs.</p>
            <p>But to go further, our Ceremonies are not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but alſo hurtful and dangerous. Thoſe Thoughts and Affections that ſhould be wholly, and ſpiritually fixed upon God, they divide and divert; part whereof, at leaſt, they draw upon themſelves: they deprive People of their Chriſtian Liberty, bring in again a Ceremonial Law, by our Saviour aboliſhed; they uſher in Superſtition, if not Idolatry, and produce many an Evil beſides; and if to Reaſon we may joyn Experience, we ſhall find they have been the cauſe and occaſion of a World of Miſchief. They have diſturbed the Peace of the Church, given Scandal, cauſed Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Perſecutions, defiled Churches, inſtead of adorning them, as pretended; broken Unity, under the Notion of ſettling Uniformity: All which miſchiefs might eaſily be prevented, if they would be prevailed to lay them aſide.</p>
            <p>They are inconvenient; conveniency is eſteemed when a thing after the conſideration of all circumſtances, is found at leaſt to bring with it more Good than Evil; but our Ceremonies by Experience, have brought more Evil than Good: <hi>They can do hurt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza, but no good: God knows,</hi> ſaith <hi>Foxe, they be the cauſe of much blindneſs and ſtrife amongſt Men; they have been, and ſtill are notoriouſly abuſed unto Superſtition.</hi> The ſum of the ſecond Commandment is, that in the Worſhip of God, or Ceremonies thereabouts, we are to deviſe nothing of our own head, or borrow any thing of Heatheniſh or Idolatrous Rites; our Ceremonies have an aptneſs to provoke to Superſtition and Idolatry; in Popiſh Countreys, the Croſs is an Idol. Now as God hath forbidden <hi>to ſowe the Field with mingled Seed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 19.19</note> ſo in the Church there ought to be no mixture of Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions with God's Inſtitutions; Ceremonies borrowed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41736:13"/>from Idolaters, ſuch are Papiſts, are vicious and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Worſhip, therefore not to be borrowed of them. The <hi>Jews</hi> by God's Command,<note place="margin">Levit. 18.3.</note> were <hi>not to live according to the Laws and Examples of other Nations.</hi> The words of <hi>Pelicanus</hi> upon the place are remarkable: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by this one Law would have them caſt away, and abhor whatſoever in Worſhip had pleaſed the Gentiles, much more care ought Chriſtians to have of this, who being taught to Worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, ought firſt and laſt to have abhorred the idle, unreaſonable and deceitful Forms and Rites of Idolaters. which if the ancient Biſhops had well conſidered, the Church had never been peſtered with ſo many prophane Rites and baſe Ceremonies; by which it came to paſs that ſome Chriſtians differ little from Gentiles, ſave in the Names of their Idols.</hi> This is home and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; this was commanded for deteſtation of Idolatry, becauſe Idolaters did ſo, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> may not do ſo: In Ceremonies we muſt ſtrictly hold to the Word of God, leaſt we tranſgreſs either in number or in form: And the like Command is given in two ſeveral places of the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6 14. Rev. 18.4.</note> to ſhew we are bound to the ſame under the Goſpel as they were under the Law; nay, God therein looks narrowly into the things that ſeems the leaſt, only that they ſhould not be like the Heathens, <hi>Ye ſhall not round the Corners of your Head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 19.27.</note> 
               <hi>neither ſhalt thou mar the Corners of thy Beard.</hi> We are commanded to <hi>keep our ſelves from Idols,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 5.21.</note> and from Idolatry and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of it; or to have any thing to do with what hath been, or is abuſed to Idolatry: Such as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are our Ceremonies; and ſo becauſe unprofitable, unneceſſary, dangerous, hurtful and inconvenient, ought to be aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; they are unlawful, becauſe Will-Worſhip, which is ſo expreſly forbidden in the Word of God,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.2.</note> 
               <hi>which we muſt never add to nor diminiſh from.</hi> God commanded <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 8.5.</note> 
               <hi>See that thou make all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41736:13"/>to the Pattern ſhewed to thee in the Mount:</hi> The true Worſhip is that appointed by God, and the falſe is that not appointed by God; for there is but two kinds of Worſhip: Firſt, True and Good. Secondly, Falſe and Evil: That is the ſame which he hath commanded, This is that which he hath not commanded; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Man's Inventions he hath not commanded, but forbidden. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>That is forbidden which is not permitted.</hi> That is, we muſt account that not to be permitted by the Word, againſt which any reaſons out of the Word may be given, though there be no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Word againſt it. Though there were free-will Offerings, whence they would ſet up <hi>Will-Worſhip,</hi> yet they were to be of ſuch things as were manifeſtly known to be preſcribed by God's revealed Will, and ſo not the Offering, but the undertaking of it at ſuch a time, or in ſuch a meaſure, was left unto the free Choice of Men according to occaſion. 'Tis no Will-Worſhip to pray thrice or ſeven times a day, to Preach once, twice or thrice on Sabbath-day; to Pray and Preach are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duties; but how often that comes under the neceſſary Circumſtances of God's Worſhip, as to Time and Place: Prayer is expreſſly allowed by God's Word, and the determination of it as to this or that time, is to be ruled by Reaſon; and theſe are the things which fall under that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Such things are allowed as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of outward Worſhip, but not ſuch as <hi>Croſs</hi> or <hi>Surplice:</hi> Now all Humane Ceremonies impoſed and obſerved as parts of God's Worſhip are unlawful, and this is the true queſtion; <hi>We muſt Ceremoniſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanus, only according to God's Word;</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin, all feigned Worſhip is forbidden;</hi> all Worſhip which is not of God, but is ſet up by Men: when Worſhip or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is feigned to be done to the true God in ſome work which he hath not enjoyned: And <hi>Zanchi</hi> ſaith, <hi>We may not Worſhip God with any other Worſhip</hi> (though it be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41736:14"/>in the kind of External and Ceremonial) <hi>than that which he hath required in the Holy Scripture to be worſhipped by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Ceremonies are Superſtitious, and this makes them alſo unlawful. Now ſaith <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> Superſtition is that which addeth Humane Inventions to Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: 'Tis a Will-Worſhip which is more than is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Law of God,<note place="margin">On Acts 17.4.</note> ſaith Dr. <hi>Fulk.</hi> And <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">On the ſecond Command.</note> Superſtition is Worſhip of God without his Commandment; they cannot wipe off the imputation of Superſtition, ſeeing they judge them neceſſary in their uſe, though indifferent in their nature: Thus a Miniſter may not read without a Surplice, nor Baptiſe without the Sign of the Croſs; but their Superſtition appeareth the more, in that they make them to be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Ceremonies, which we ſhall have farther occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>They divide their Ceremonies into ſingle and double and threefold; the former are thoſe whoſe uſe is only for Decency and Order; the others ſerve alſo for Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by ſome profitable ſignification; but if all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances belonging to Time, Place, Perſons, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſacred Actions, be ſacred ſignificant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then not only the Clock, but the leaden Weights of it, not only the Ground which they do ſtand upon, but alſo the Ruſhes by occaſion ſtrewed upon it, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, the Miniſter's Black Cap, or Perriwig, his Beard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be holy, ſignificant, dumb and ſpeaking Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; dumb becauſe unprofitable, ſpeaking idly in ſuch a place: When an Image of the bleſſed Virgin ſpake to <hi>Bernard</hi> in the Church, <hi>Good morrow</hi> Bernard, <hi>good morrow,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>O Madam, you forget your Sex, it is not lawful for a Woman to ſpeak in the Church:</hi> Juſt ſo ſhould be ſilenced our idle ſignificant Ceremonies; the more becauſe the Goſpel is <hi>the perfect law of liberty.</hi>

            <p>Theſe Humane ſignificant Ceremonies are in ſome kind a Sacrament, which none but God may inſtitute; nay, they wrong Sacraments; for it argues them of ſome imperfection, as if in God's Inſtitution ſomething had been wanting that was neceſſary to be ſupplied by Men: when they are uſed to teach any ſpiritual Duty by their myſtical ſignification, they uſurp a chief part of the Nature of Sacraments, and without thoſe Rites the Sacraments ſignifie the ſame things as Chriſt and our Duty to him; ſo that every Humane Invention appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to God's Service, ordained and inſtituted to teach any ſpiritual Duty by myſtical ſignification is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. The ſecond Commandment forbiddeth to make the likeneſs of any thing whatſoever for Religious Uſe: Now ſignificant Ceremonies are external acts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip, even as they are uſed to further Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore being invented by Man, are of the ſame Nature with Images, by which and in which God is worſhipped: but only ſuch outward means muſt be uſed in God's Worſhip, which he himſelf hath allowed; no means may be uſed to ſtir up Devotion, and to put Men in remembrance of good things, but only thoſe which God hath ordained; and this directly brings us to the queſtion between <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who would have Images, Croſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be the Books of ignorant People, and to inſtruct them in their ſpiritual Duty; though the Prophet calls them <hi>teachers of lies;</hi>

            <p>To palliate the uſe of theſe Popiſh Ceremonies amongſt us, it muſt not be ſaid they are not abuſed in our Churches as they be amongſt Papiſts, who can tell us pretty Tales, when we object, they have amongſt them the Idolatrous Things, Cuſtoms and Places of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41736:15"/>'Tis true, ſay they, but they abuſed them to Idolatry; but we have converted them to a better uſe, to a better Worſhip of the true God: Inſtead of their <hi>Mars</hi> God of War, we have our Chriſtian Champions; we diſown their <hi>Neptune,</hi> but have St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Saint, who protects thoſe that go upon Waters. Their <hi>Pantheon,</hi> or Temple of all their Gods, we dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Virgin, and to all our Saints, and much more of ſuch ſtuff. 'Tis to be wiſhed that Leſſon was not appliable to us in matter of Ceremonies: we may ſay, Papiſts abuſe them, but not we; this is no good reaſon, whileſt in the mean while we have them in our Churches. Let us not deceive our ſelves, our Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Inſtitution, Intention, or what you pleaſe, doth not alter the Nature of the thing; an Idol of <hi>Baal</hi> is an Idol, whether in <hi>Babylon, Jeruſalem</hi> or <hi>Samaria:</hi> So a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Ceremony is ſuperſtitious, whether in <hi>Rome</hi> or in <hi>London.</hi> The Nature of a Ceremony doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Inſtitution; it doth not ſo much as entitle to Decency. The Whiteneſs or Decency of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-table-cloth, doth not ariſe out of the Inſtitution, but out of the habitude of the thing; which if it was foul and naſty would not be Decent, let all the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do what it could: that the Miniſter ſhould not turn his Back but his Face to the Miniſter when he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is not this Comelineſs in the natural aptneſs of the action without Inſtitution? Is there no Decency in this? Or can the Inſtitution of the contrary be Decent? The ſame we may ſay of People hearing a Sermon ſitting or ſtanding, and not all along upon their Faces. We know there is Moral and Ceremonial Worſhip, but Divine Ceremonies as ſuch are parts of God's Worſhip; for every <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind as it is a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> is part of his <hi>genus:</hi> Divine Ceremonies as ſuch, are ſpecies of Religious Worſhip, wherefore we muſt have a care not to mix humane Ceremonies with thoſe that are Divine.</p>

            <p>What is ſaid about Inſtitution, may be ſpoken of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; Papiſts ſay, the Intention in the uſe of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies makes them lawful or unlawful; then they muſt be ſure every one that uſeth them hath a good Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which 'tis very difficult for them to know, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſearchers of the Heart: Beſides, we know how foully the Doctrine of directing the Intention, is abuſed by Papiſts. 'Tis to be wiſhed this caſe did not come up to us, and we were not too far engaged with them in this point; for to ſay <hi>Papiſts</hi> retain <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Ceremonies for Superſtition, but we not ſo, is but a bare Aſſertion, and 'tis ſure we retain <hi>Popiſh</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I do not ſee why they ſhould not amongſt us as well as amongſt them tend to Superſtition: We own the Popiſh Religion doth chiefly conſiſt in an outward ſhew and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies; and if in theſe things we trade with them and receive five, we might as well receive five hundred; and 'tis unknown what at laſt we may come to: The door is open for ſome, others may follow by degrees, or in a Croud. Let us not be wiſer than God, or truſt our ſtrength too much; we give Papiſts advantage upon us, and matter of bragging, with cauſe of hardning themſelves that we borrowed our Ceremonies from them, and this ſtring they hung upon amongſt us, or elſe one way or other they had been gone: but by the ſame reaſon ſome Ceremonies were taken away, all ought to have been.</p>
            <p>We return to the Intention and ſay, 'tis not the Opinion that Men have, that makes a true or falſe Worſhip, but the nature of the thing as already ſaid; for thus a Man may go to Maſs, conceiving a private Opinion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf different from that which Maſsmongers have, ſo he may fancy he doth not ſin, when he commits a groſs one: <hi>Calderinus,</hi> when he was about going to Maſs uſed to ſay, <hi>eamus ad communem errorem,</hi> let us go to the vulgar Error; but going to Maſs, that is, doing all thoſe

            <p>All this while our Ceremonies go upon a wrong Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which 'tis neceſſary to beat them off; and this is it, they think the Church hath power to inſtitute all ſuch things, but a preliminary queſtion is, who that Church is?

            <p>To ſee how in theſe matters they tread the ſteps of Popery; they aſſert how ſome ſuch Worſhip is good, which is not taught in Scripture; that many teaching Ceremonies which God never inſtituted, may by Men be brought in to Worſhip, Images themſelves not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; that Additions to God's Word, ſo they be not contrary to it, may and ought to be made: The ſum of their Doctrine in this point is by <hi>Hooker</hi> ſet down in his Book of Eccleſiaſtical Policy: He hath theſe words, <hi>much the Church of God ſhall always need that which the Scripture teaches not.</hi>

General Rules for Civil Policy may be given in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet not ſo fully and clearly taught as in the Old, or as Religious Worſhip is now in the New; the Rule of clean and unclean Beaſts was general, and eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable

Wherefore we muſt agree, that the Lord Jeſus appointed all neceſſary things for the being and well-being of his Church, ſo there is nothing left for Men to add unto it; and let thoſe who pretend to an Authority to make Additions, have a care what they do; for this is to bring ſtrange fire into the Houſe of God, and let them remember the Crime and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu.</hi> Now God will ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed Inventions of Men in his Worſhip, no more then he would allow them of ſtrange Fire; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this terrible Judgment given in the Text is, <hi>which he commanded them not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10.1.</note> So that in this caſe, what is not commanded is forbidden; and to do any thing without a Precept is an heinous ſin: Thus we need no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt all theſe Ceremonies, Additions, and Humane Inventions, then this, God hath not commanded them.

               <hi>which I commanded them not:</hi> He makes a high Aggravation to the Sin, becauſe in matter of Worſhip nothing is to be done without his expreſs Commandment; ſo, that which is without, and beſides the Word is againſt it.

They that go ſo far, would go farther if they could, they who take upon them to make Additions or Alterations in his Service, would preſcribe the whole too, and may be, at laſt order his actings, and perhaps, meddle with his own Nature, for indeed, by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they meddle with one, they might do ſo with the other; yet, when God ſpeaks, the whole Earth ſhould be ſilent, and hold their peace: Yet ſome will not, but as it were, would be preſcribing, and make in his houſe new Laws, contrary to, or at leaſt different from thoſe he hath enacted: To ſhew how pragmatical and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory our Nature is in ſuch things, let the Caſe of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi>

            <p>It were well if that People, who have ſo great a mind to be meddling with a legiſlative and inſtitutive Power in the Church would conſider this, there is no ſuch thing, no ſuch Ceremony either done or inſtituted by Chriſt, therefore let us not think our ſelves wiſer than he or his Apoſtles:<note place="margin">De Sacram.</note>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41736:20"/>Infallibility upon our Church, nor ſtretch her Power ſo as to tranſubſtantiate things; a Prayer made in the Houſe of <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Commons,</hi> doth not ceaſe from being a religious Duty to become a civil one: Such an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth not alter the Nature of it.</p>
            <p>To prove the Churches Authority, to inſtitute their unneceſſary Ceremonies which we deny, after they have ſcrewed up their Wits with Endeavours to prove it out of Scripture of the New Teſtament; they can find but one place which they ſtretch as far as they can, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> they think they may bring into the Church what they pleaſe, not only all <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but alſo all <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, if the Convocation and Rulers of the Church think them to be decent and for Order: The Place is, <hi>let all things be done decently and in order:</hi>

               <hi>Let all things be done to edifying:</hi> That which is granted, is to have things done decently and in order for Edification: Edification is the end, Decency and Order the means, or as we may call it, a decent Order tending to Edification; thus an holy Sacrament muſt be decently and orderly, or in a decent order adminiſtred: This Decency and Order relate to Place, Time, Manner, Perſons, Number, as how many Pſalms ſung, Sermons preached, Chapters read, and the like Circumſtances, the Apoſtle leaves no more to the Churches Liberty, than to order God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to be performed in a decent manner: Any Conſtitution beyond ordering that which before was enjoyned, is properly a Law; now Chriſt is the only Lawgiver of his Church, which receiveth no other Laws but his, and any Laws added to God's Laws, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them which are really perfect in themſelves, in their Reaſon and Manner, and thoſe of the Church are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41736:21"/>but Directions for better obſerving of Divine Laws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Diverſity of Times, Places, and Perſons, which are occaſional Circumſtances, and no new things in God's Worſhip: The Churches Authority, as I alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obſerved, is but Miniſterial to ſee thoſe things obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved which Chriſt hath appointed, not to inſtitute any new things. <hi>Decency</hi> is when God's Worſhip is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with thoſe convenient Circumſtances of Geſture, and ſuch as I already named, agreeing not only with God's Service, but alſo with any grave Aſſembly: In this place <hi>Order</hi> is ſtrictly taken in Oppoſition to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, ſo is Decency oppoſed to the Vice of Undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; hence it follows, that Order doth require nothing but what is neceſſary to avoid Confuſion, and Decency to hinder Undecency. Our Ceremoniſts muſt give me leave to make them take notice how they are guilty of the Breach of two things contained in that Chapter; the firſt of Confuſion, for to ſpeak all together aloud, as they do in the uſe of the Common-Prayer-Book, makes a confuſe Noiſe, and brings in a Confuſion; thus they interrupt one anothers Devotion:<note place="margin">Verſ. 28.</note> The Apoſtle forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ſpeak all at once: Cannot they follow the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter when he reads,<note place="margin">Verſ. 34.</note> and according to the Apoſtle's <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> ſpeak every one to himſelf and to God; Another Breach they are guilty of, is directly againſt Women keeping ſilence and not ſpeaking in Churches, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they ſpeak the loudeſt. So then if they will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Apoſtles end, they muſt act to edifying, which through Perſecution, they have not taken the Way to do; he tells them the right Way, Charity, wherein they have been ſo wanting,<note place="margin">Cor. 8.1.</note> 
               <hi>edifyeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Ceremonies contribute nothing towards Order and Decency, Baptiſm is as decently adminiſtred without, as with the Sign of the Croſs, and publick Prayers as decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read without a Surplice as with it, but if they be added to cloth Religion, 'tis to accuſe her of Nakedneſs; but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41736:21"/>Chriſt hath made a ſufficient Proviſion for it, without ſuch things, which they ought not to maintain, except they can prove God is better ſerved with them than without. Now the Apoſtle's Scope in the place, is to charge the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> in their meetings, to avoid Confuſion, and what is unbecoming, as to ſpeak in unknown Tongues, or to prophecy all together, which would be very undecent (as in ordinary Company, to hear all talking together) and breed Confuſion, and this is the reaſon,<note place="margin">Verſ. 33.</note> 
               <hi>for God is not the Author of Confuſion:</hi> Therefore the Church which is his Houſe, muſt be a Houſe of Order; he doth not give them leave to bring any new thing of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, but only to obſerve a Decency, and not to ſpeak in unknown Tongues, whereby they would be <hi>Barbarians one to another,</hi> and others <hi>would think they are mad:</hi> And alſo in not prophecying all at once,<note place="margin">V. 11. V. 23. Verſ. 37.</note> but one after another, to obſerve an Order in performing the things he writes to them, which he calls <hi>the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord;</hi> and no doubt this was to reform Abuſes about theſe things crept into their Church. So this Text doth not in the leaſt favour our Ceremony-mongers, and 'tis no Warrant for them to uſurp a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of inſtituting unneceſſary ſignificant Ceremonies with ſuch circumſtantial Appertenances as I named a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, they may direct about God's Worſhip, but not to bring Innovations into it: I ſay Appertenances, but not Parts, which yet they confound, though there be a Difference, ſo a Rochet, Laund Sleeves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Appertenaces, but no parts of a Biſhop, a Surplice an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertenance, but no Part of a Reader, Hair Apperte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but no Part of the Body.</p>
            <p>A thing which prevailes much upon ſome of them is this, theſe Ceremonies, ſay they, in themſelves are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but being commanded by Authority, they become neceſſary, and we ought to obey them; this Principle they go upon, is falſe upon theſe two Accounts.

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The things are not indifferent. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They who inſtitute and impoſe them may not do it; as to the firſt, that ſuch things are not indifferent; that is, they may not lawfully be uſed or not be uſed. I made it appear, when I proved them to be unlawful and ſuperſtitious, which I think to have ſufficiently performed. for any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the Worſhip of God, to ſignifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, and then the Practiſe thereof impoſed upon People without a Warrant from the Word of God, is unlawful, and conſequently, far from being indifferent; and ſuppoſe in their Nature they were not unlawful as they are, yet upon the acccount of the Abuſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about them, they become ſinful in their uſe; the Rule of indifferent things and not neceſſary is, if they be polluted with Idolatry and Superſtition, ought to be aboliſhed:<note place="margin">Reſponſ. ad Verſipellem.</note> It is moſt right and ſound, ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> to ſay that the Inſtitutions of God may not be aboliſhed for any Abuſe; but Human Inſtitutions being defiled, and ſo proving hurtful and offenſive to our Brethren, are to be abſtained from; the Superſtition againſt which true Worſhippers of God do fight, came, for the moſt part from unknown Puddles, and all are ſoiled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Errour, which can never be removed but by utter aboliſhing of their Uſe: Why then do we not ſimply ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that which is true, namely, that this Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of aboliſhing their Uſe, is Neceſſary for taking off Droſs from the Church:<note place="margin">Diſput.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41736:22"/>we cannot retain them: We ſee how thoſe firſt Inſtruments of Reformation uſed the ſame Arguments againſt Papiſts, as we do againſt our Ceremony-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Papiſts uſed the ſame againſt them as our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniſts do againſt us, ſo that Cauſe is the ſame, only there is more or leſs in the caſe, and there is no Pretence to ſay ſuch things are indifferent, which maketh <hi>Beza</hi> ſay in another place, how that Text of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. is to be underſtood of Superſtitions, which ſome do fooliſhly call indifferent things.</p>
            <p>Now I come to ſhew how they who inſtitute and impoſe ſuch Ceremonies, have no right, and may not do it, and ſo ought not to be obeyed: It had been well if they had never given juſt Cauſe to queſtion this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power of theirs, which is a meer Uſurpation, they go beyond their Commiſſion and cannot anſwer it: 'Tis to be wiſhed there was no ground to ſuſpect there is in many of them too much of ſelf-Intereſt; In the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> their great <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Cardinals,</hi> though ſometimes for the preſent they feel Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies under the exorbitant Power of <hi>Popes,</hi> yet all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, and cry it up, becauſe none of them hath caſt away Hopes of raiſing to that Dignity, and then they will exact from others that uncontroulable Obedience and Reſpect which once they yielded their Superiour; ſo may be ſome amongſt us, as being fed with Hopes at one time or other it will be their turn to have an upper hand in the Government of the Church, are, againſt their Knowledge, content to ſtoop and ſubmit to things which in their Judgment they do not approve, becauſe when they come to it, they will uſe others as once they were uſed; if ſo, 'tis a Miniſtery of Iniquity, and I appeal to the Conſciences of ſome of them: All theſe Practiſes are ſubſervient to ſuch Uſurpations, but can never juſtifie them, and in ſuch a caſe Scripture gives both Precept and Example, and with the Apoſtles we

               <hi>We ought to obey God rather than Men:</hi> Nay, with the ſame, we may boldly refer to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Rulers of Synagogues, and ſay, <hi>Whether it be right in the Sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye:</hi> Let them not ſay that what the Apoſtles did, and what we do ſay is upon a different account; we know there are ſeveral ſorts of Truths; yea, ſome more important than others; however, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Divine Truth is a Truth to be owned and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every Divine Truth is of a high Concernment: That which we ſtand for in our preſent Queſtions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns no leſs than two of the three Offices of our bleſſed Lord and Mediator, the firſt, his <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office, whether in the Church we may hear any other Voice but his, which is revealed in his Word? Then his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Office, whether we may receive and obey any other Laws, Inſtitutions, and Ordinances, but what he hath himſelf appointed?

            <p>Theſe Matters about Ceremonies were under Debate, not only here, but alſo in other Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> in the Beginning and Progreſs of Reformation: <hi>Junius</hi> who died a Divinity Profeſſor at <hi>Leyden,</hi> ſaith, If any Man, either by Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Authority, will add things not neceſſary nor agreeable to Order, we would not pertinaciouſly contend with him, but deſire only that he would ſeriouſly conſider of three things; firſt, by what Authority or Example he is led to think, that the holy Church of God, and the Simplicity of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſt, whoſe Voice only is heard by his Sheep, muſt be clothed with Human Traditions which Chriſt doth reject. Secondly, To what end he judgeth that thoſe things ſhould be added unto thoſe that are Divine, for if the End be Conformity with others, it were more Equity that other Churches ſhould conform to thoſe which come neareſt to the Word of God (as <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Counſel is) than that theſe ſhould conform to the others, if the End be Comelineſs, what is more comely than the Simplicity of Chriſt? What is more ſimple than that Comelineſs? If there be no other Reaſon beſides Will, then that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is to be thought of; the Will of God is the chief Neceſſity, and the Church of God is not tied unto Man's Wiſdom in divine things: The third thing to be thought on is, what Event hath always followed upon human Traditions, as a long Experience doth ſhew: And as <hi>Polanus,</hi> another Author well known,<note place="margin">Syntag. lib. 9. cap. 3, 6, 8.</note> ſaith, Superſtition ſtands in chuſing Worſhip to God, or when one exceedeth Meaſure therein: True Religion worſhipeth the true God in a manner preſcribed by the Word; falſe, that is, Superſtition, worſhips God other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he willeth, or enjoyneth, and elſewhere,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41736:24"/>whatſoever pertaineth to God's Worſhip, muſt by him be required;<note place="margin">Lib. 9. cap. 28.</note> in another place he adds, it is a fooliſh ill Zeal of the Popiſh Clergy to uſe ſuch Player-like Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel in Divine Service, and thereby to be diſtinguiſhed from Lay-men; that Difference and Variety under the Old Teſtament was Typical, but the Subſtance being come, what mean they to require Types any more? And if upon this matter we will hear few Words more of <hi>Calvin</hi> to <hi>Caſſander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Opuſc. pag. 355.</note> he taught that the Ceremonies ordained by Chriſt are intirely and uncorruptly to be kept, and nothing muſt be added to their Inſtitution, as if thy were lame or imperfect, which indeed is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what but not all, becauſe by an indirect Shift he would let into the Church all other Rites; but this half Truth is overturned, when he believes a Right given to the Apoſtles and Succeſſors to inſtitute ſuch Ceremonies in the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments which may be for Ornament, therefore he which before confeſſed nothing ſhould be added, doth now not only admit ſuch By-Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but alſo commends them, yet will he help himſelf with a ſubtle Shift, namely, Additions muſt be allowed, if the Sacrament be not held lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, therefore with what Mixtures you will, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be wholly changed, and yet all be well, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you charge not Chriſt to his Teeth that any of his Inſtitutions go lame and halting.</p>
            <p>Theſe Witneſſes I bring in, not only to ſhew their rational way of arguing upon this Subject, but alſo to let Men ſee how there were thoſe beyond Seas who ſtood in Oppoſition to Human Inventions in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and conſequently it was not a Spirit of Refractori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as they call it, that made here ſeveral learned and pious Men ſpeak and write againſt them from the Beginning: The Truth is, the moſt wiſe God needeth none of our Help to find out means to excite Faith, nor would the meaneſt Mechanick in his Profeſſion endure,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41736:24"/>but would himſelf take his own way and not be put out of it: See then how bold are theſe Men, who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to God means how to help forward our Salvation, and that Decency which they would make a ſtalking Horſe of, is, as <hi>Pareus</hi> ſaith, oppoſed to Vanity,<note place="margin">Upon 1 Cor. 14.</note> Spots and Riot, it ſtands not in Hoods, Caps, or Vizards of fond Ceremonies, Thus our Reaſons we back with the Authority of ſome famous Men, and ſhall do it farther to ſhew we are not ſingular in our Opinion; they and we do all draw out of the ſame Spring, the Word of God: But I now conclude this Point with thoſe notable Words of <hi>Calvin, It is Devilliſh Blaſphemy to ſay that God hath taught Men all that it behoveth them to do:</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Deuter. Serm. 85.</note> 
               <hi>Common by-word here hath place, thou art the Devil's Servant, for thou haſt done more than was commanded thee.</hi>

               <p>HAving thus briefly ſpoken of Ceremonies in general (for I intend, as much as I can, to contract my Diſcourſe) I muſt now ſpeak of them in particular: We ſhall begin with the Croſs, whereof the aerial Sign is uſed in Baptiſm; this is one of their ſignificant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, a Help to Devotion, as they ſay, which ſignifieth unto us that we ſhould not be aſhamed of Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I would know whether and where Chriſt the only Authentick Appointer of means appropriated to God's Service, teacheth this Doctrine? 'Tis not enough for me to ſay, 'tis the Doctrine and Practiſe of the Church, I muſt be ſatisfied how the Head and only Lawgiver of the Church hath commanded it; with them 'tis alſo a ſign of Conſtancy, but to what purpoſe is this? Doth not the Sacrament teach us the ſame thing? Are we not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41736:25"/>with him buried by Baptiſm, and with him raiſed in Newneſs of Life? Do we not in Baptiſm give Chriſt our Names, take his Livery and Badges upon us, and as much as in us lies, make a Vow to forſake all to follow Chriſt the crucified? Are we not thereby admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church to fight under his Banners during the whole Courſe of our Life againſt all our Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Doth the Sign of the Croſs ſignifie any more than this? The Ceremony is then a ſuperfluous thing, ſeeing it can ſignifie no more, nor do more good than the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth: This Signification being an Engagement that we ſhall not be aſhamed of the Croſs, muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, muſt be in Faith, without which it is Sin, but how can there be Faith where is no Word of Precept or Promiſe? As there is none at all, but I know what there is in the Practice of this Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, namely, an abominable Preſumption and Addition to the Sacrament, which is not of the Inſtitution, this impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as if the Ordinance was imperfect, and ſomething in it wanting which muſt be added by Man, and we have no more leave given us to add to the Sacraments, than to the Word under the threatned <hi>Penalties.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 22.18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And though this Sign of the Croſs be an ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, 'tis never the better for that; <hi>Antiquity without Truth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyprian, is an old Error.</hi> However the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament without it, is much more ancient: Wherefore, when Water, thorough the fault of the Pipe, or of ſome other Cauſe, groweth bad and corrupt, we muſt go to the Spring: <hi>Illud verum quod pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> ſaith one, that's true which agrees with the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Hereticks firſt uſed the Croſs in Baptiſm, and gave alſo the Lord's Supper to Infants, which muſt be owned to be ill, becauſe they could not examine themſelves, nor diſcern the Lord's Body, and as this Cuſtom hath been left, ſo there was as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have left the other, as others have been too,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41736:25"/>when Men found cauſe for it; 'twas a Cuſtom in <hi>Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>'s, ſome ſay in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, at the receiving of the Lord's Supper, to ſop the Bread into the Cup, this continued for ſome hundred of Years, and laſted as long as that of Infants receiving of the Lord's Supper, but were left off, not without good Reaſons, ſo might Croſs in Baptiſm have been left with as much Reaſon, for ſopping was not worſe than it, ſopping was an Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Croſs an Addition, which is as bad every jot as Alteration if not of the things inſtituted, yet of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as making it inſufficient or imperfect by it ſelf alone, for when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>do this,</hi> he meaned as well do this only, as do this all; more is to be ſaid for ſop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which was uſed by Chriſt at the very Table of the Supper, but the Sign of the Croſs was never uſed by the Lord Jeſus: If croſſing ought to be uſed in Baptiſm, the Apoſtles in their Doctrine concerning it would have made ſome mention of it, except ſome would think they then did not know, or cared not to uſe the beſt way of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Chriſtian Valour and Conſtancy in fighting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt's Banner.</p>
               <p>If this Sign of the Croſs, or any other Ceremony in Baptiſm be referred to Order or Decency, as it is, is it not thereby blaſphemouſly to accuſe the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and of the Apoſtles, which was without it, of Diſorder and Uncomelineſs? Whereas the Comelineſs and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Sacraments is to be eſteemed by the Word of God, by the Inſtitution of Chriſt, by the Simplicity of the Goſpel, and by the Practice of the Apoſtles, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more decent and orderly than that which Chriſt commandeth and alloweth, nothing more undecent and unſeemly than that which Men invent in the Service of God, and in the Celebration of the Sacraments, thereby inverting and perver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing the holy Ordinances of God; Is it not a ſtrange thing, that though in Scripture the Croſs be neither commanded nor permitted, yet the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41736:26"/>Rule is, <hi>Croſs or Baptize not,</hi> a Child ſhall be deprived of the Sacrament, of the Seal of the Covenant, if the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Croſs be not with it, this is as bad, if not worſe than Anabaptiſm, and I think they have more to ſay for not baptizing Infants, than theſe People have to deny Baptiſm upon ſuch an account, and no doubt that hath made ſeveral <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> for ſome Men being in Conſcience diſſatisfied with that Ceremony, would not have their Children baptized with it; thus they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keep them unbaptized, but rather than they ſhould not be at all, having kept them ſo till they were older, they inclined to have them baptized in their way. I cannot tell how thoſe that have a Commiſſion from Chriſt to preach and to baptize, can anſwer at laſt for refuſing upon ſuch an account to baptize; for they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Commiſſion: 'tis moſt certain the Lord never ſaid, baptize with the Sign of the Croſs, but <hi>baptize in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> So that except Men refuſe to be baptized in that Name which no body doth, being a viſible Member of the Church, 'tis an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Wickedneſs and Diſobedience upon ſuch an account to deny Baptiſm; with a juſt Cauſe we complain againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> for taking away the half of one Sacrament, and have we not much more reaſon to cry out againſt thoſe amongſt us, who having a poſitive Command to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, do wilfully and unjuſtly deprive the Children of believing Parents of the Seales of the Covenant which God hath abſolutely ordered to be adminiſtred unto them?</p>
               <p>In Popery the Croſs is not only an Occaſion of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but is alſo made an Idol, they kneel before, and as ſuch do Worſhip it; and where they pretend to have a piece of the Wood of the Croſs, they lay it up as a moſt holy Relick, have Days appointed to come kiſs and worſhip it upon their Knees, they ſuppoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to be done by it, and have Prayers made for it;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41736:26"/>ought not the Thoughts of this, make any one that hates Idolatry to deteſt and abhor the Idol, and not ſo much as to endure the Sight of it: but not only the Croſs, but alſo the Sign of it is abuſed amongſt them, they believe the Sign of the Croſs, <hi>Opere operato,</hi> as they call, of it ſelf, and being made, hath the Vertue to drive away Devils, and to this ſame purpoſe they uſe it in Baptiſm, in conſecrating Churches, baptizing of Bells, making their Holy Water, exerciſing, ſaying Maſs, and in every thing elſe they do in Religion, ſo that amongſt them there is not one Ceremony more generally abuſed than this; they uſe it alſo to keep off the Thunderbolt, and if in a Morning when they go out, they do but make the Sign of the Croſs, they think themſelves ſafe enough for the reſt of the Day: And though amongſt us it be not abuſed to that Degree, yet ſtill it is in ſome Degree: But as I would not drink out of a Cup where I know there hath been Poiſon, thus in Matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I would have nothing to do with any thing that was and is ſtill in the <hi>Golden Cup full of Abominations of the Mother of Harlots.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 17.4.</note> Away then with Popery, for of the Word <hi>Papa</hi> every Letter makes a Word, <hi>Poculum aureum plenum Abominationum, The Golden Cup full of Abominations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things more I ſhall add to this: <hi>Firſt,</hi> How the Croſs and Sign of it is the chief Idol of Popery, and the thing moſt abuſed amongſt them, for though their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer-God be their eſſential Idol; yet it never becomes a God, except the Sign of the Croſs be many a time made over it, and this I may call the proper and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Mark of the Beaſt, which in Scripture is ſaid to be in the <hi>right hand or in the Forehead,</hi> which is thus,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.16.</note> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they make the Sign of the Croſs, 'tis with their Right Hand Part on the Forehead, the right and left Arms, and Part on the Breaſt, pronouncing theſe Latine Words, <hi>In nomine patris,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt thing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41736:27"/>they teach their Children is to make that Sign of the Croſs, at their Graces before and after Meat, they ever uſe the Sign of the Croſs, 'tis the firſt and laſt thing they do when they riſe and when they go to Bed, and in a Morning before they go out, they look upon it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Preſervative againſt ill Accidents; and if any Miſchance befalls one, they will ſay it is becauſe he did not before make the Sign of the Croſs, and that's the chief thing their Prieſts do commend to Children and others, be ſure whatſoever you do to make the Sign of the Croſs; and when they come into their Churches and and go out, the firſt and laſt thing they do, is to dip a Finger into their Holy-water-pot, and to make the Sign of the Croſs: When they go to, and come from Pilgrimage to their pretended Saints, they never are without little Croſſes, either on their Hats, Cloths, in their Pockets, or ſomewhere elſe about them, and this is one of the Merchandiſes they buy in ſuch Places. All their Souldiers, or <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> as they called themſelves, that went to their Holy Wars, either againſt the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi> or againſt the poor <hi>Albigenſes, Vaudois,</hi> and the like, croſſed themſelves, or had a Croſs on their Cloths, whence were called their <hi>Cruciada</hi> or <hi>Croiſade.</hi> In few Words, Croſſes they have in their Churches, Convents, Gardens, Houſes, High-ways, and every one carrys Beads and Croſſes, they are to be ſeen in their Pulpits, and Altar-cloths upon every Church (this we are not free from,) Croſs here, and Croſs there, and Croſs every where, and they look upon the Croſs, and the Sign of it as an univerſal Remedy againſt all manner of Evil: They ſay, that as many as are not marked with the Sign of the Croſs upon the Forehead, are damned and reprobate,<note place="margin">Analyſ. pag. 77.</note> as is noted by M. <hi>Rogers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And more particularly, to ſhew how this Croſs and aerial Sign of the Croſs is the Characteriſtical Note and Mark, or Name, or Number of the Name of the Beaſt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41736:27"/>formerly, and of late, as I know it out of certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe ſome weak Proteſtants beyond the Sea, would out of Fear paſs for Papiſts; Prieſts and others uſed two ways to find them out; firſt they asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had any Croſs and Beads, which never are one without the other, if they had none, then they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Heretick, and uſed them accordingly; but if they had, becauſe it was herein an eaſie thing for them to counterfeit, then to diſcover them they put them to this further Tryal, namely, to make the Sign of the Croſs upon themſelves, and hereby they commonly found them out, for Papiſts have a certain Rule for it, as what Place to begin at, then where to follow, next either right or left Arm, and where to end, but the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, not being uſed to this Ceremony, uſually mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook, and this was the <hi>Shibbolet,</hi> when they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſteal away. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> call the Croſs, one the Character of their Glory, and the other a notable Sign whereby to know a Catholick.</p>
               <p>I hope this makes it clear enough, how the Croſs, or Sign of it is the Mark of the Beaſt, ſeeing within his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Matters of Religion nothing is done without it; why then ſhould thoſe that ſay, they are the Followers of the Lamb, take and receive it upon themſelves? Surely Scripture ſaith, the Names of thoſe that have the Mark of the Beaſt are not written in the Book of the Lamb, why ſhould we have amongſt us ſuch an Idol of Jealouſie, ſo abominably abuſed to Idolatry? And this leads me to the ſecond thing I promiſed to ſpeak of, namely, how things abuſed to Idolatry, though once never ſo good, ought quite to be rejected; this I ſay not of my own Head, but out of the Word of God, and ſhall out of many Inſtances bring only three: The <hi>firſt</hi> is, of the Name <hi>Baal,</hi> which ſignifieth Lord, a true proper Name of God, a good Name indeed, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had been abuſed and attributed to the Creature,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41736:28"/>and to the Idols of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Caldeans,</hi> as I ſaid before, God abhorred it, and would no more be called by that Name, <hi>Thou ſhalt no more call me Baali,</hi> thy Lord,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>for I will take away the Names of Baalim out of her Mouth:</hi> The ſecond Inſtance is that of <hi>Groves</hi> or Altars, once they were good and acceptable things unto God, for <hi>Abraham</hi> built one,<note place="margin">Gen. 13.18. Chap. 35.7.</note> ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> by God's Command, did build another: But when once God had ſettled the Place of Worſhip, all ſuch became abominable, and thoſe Kings who either did ſet them up, or continued them, are branded for it, as thoſe who threw them down, are highly commended.

               <p>Something more I muſt ſay to this, before I leave it: The Croſs amongſt Chriſtians is what the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was amongſt the Jews; 'twas good at firſt of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, and when it had ceaſed to produce thoſe Miraculous Effects, for the which it was erected, was indifferent, but when it came to be abuſed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came evil, then a good King brake it in pieces; ſo once amongſt Chriſtians the Croſs was good: Chriſt to ſave Mankind was appointed to ſuffer on it, yet herein inferior to the Serpent, that the Wood of the Croſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrought any Miracle, after the Paſſion it was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I mean the very ſame upon the which our Lord was crucified, to have it or not, but the Multiplication or making others in Imitation, was unneceſſary, but after Idolatrous Worſhip was rendered to it, it became abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and ſo muſt be deſtroyed as being an occaſion of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>They ſay this is an ancient Cuſtom of the Church, well let it be, yet that doth not take away the Abuſe, nor make it a jot the better, is the Devil the better for being a Liar and a Murtherer from the beginning,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41736:29"/>though at firſt he was a moſt excellent Creature? but to the Point of Baptiſm, of old there hath been ſome groſs Abuſes, as firſt, the delaying of it, which though it doth intimate, they did not abſolutely believe it neceſſary to Salvation, yet it argues in them a Contempt, or elſe a Neglect of that holy Sacrament, we read in the Book of the Acts, how aſſoon as Men were converted they were baptized, as in the caſe of thoſe that heard <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, of the Eunuch, and of the <hi>Centurion</hi> and his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould and Friends: But ſome of the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">Acts 2.38, 41. chap. 8.36, 37, 38. Chap. 10 47, 48.</note> I mean 300 Years after our Saviour delayed it, as <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> who was not baptized till he was 65 Years old, which was the 31 of his Empire, in <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media,</hi> by <hi>Euſebius;</hi> his Son <hi>Constantius</hi> was baptized only at the point of his Death; ſo <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the great, and the other <hi>Theodoſius</hi> did put it off for a long time, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> delayed it, being willing to have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> but was prevented by Death, <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> were not baptized till they were 30 Years of age, <hi>Auſtin</hi> was a Manichean till 31, and then and not before, baptized by <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſo amongſt the Greeks, <hi>Chryſostom, Gregory, Nazianzenus,</hi> and <hi>Nectari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> entered into Orders before he was baptized: This was an ancient Cuſtom, even amongſt great Men, yet I hope now none will commend them for it, for certainly they might much ſooner have made a Confeſſion, and given an account of their Faith, as no doubt they were able to do.</p>
               <p>We know ſome (but I think none of thoſe I named) had a ſtrange Reaſon for ſo long putting off their being baptized, namely, that they might be the more at liberty to indulge themſelves in their Vices, for they uſed to excuſe their Failings with this, that they were not yet baptized, for they thought they were punctually to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their baptiſmal Vow to be dead to evil Works, and raiſed in Newneſs of Life, one tells us,<note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> they had
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41736:30"/>this falſe Notion, that there was no Pardon for thoſe who after Baptiſm relapſed into Sin, which was the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Novatian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In thoſe Times there was a worſe thing practiſed about Baptiſm,<note place="margin">On 1 Cor. chap. 15.</note> for <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in one of his Homilies ſpeaks of an abſurd Practice of ſome, to put a living Man under the Bed of the deceaſed, and then the dead perſon was asked whether he would be baptized, whereupon he that was under the Bed made anſwer for the dead, and deſired Baptiſm, and him they immediately baptized in the place of the dead, and this he juſtly calls there a piece of meer Mockery, an hiſtrionical Sacrament, alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrious Prophanation of Baptiſm, for thus they did but act a Part in a Play: And indeed, I believe our Queſtions in Baptiſm to the Child, and the God-father's Anſwers come very nigh to this, for the Child, though naturally alive, yet wanting the Uſe of Reaſon and Senſes, is as good as morally dead.</p>
               <p>Further, to ſee the Errors of primitive times, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the dead was anciently uſed by ſome Chriſtians, as it was uſual to give the dead the other holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as both appear to have been practiſed out of two ancient Councils, in which is a Prohibition againſt that Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, and of the Euchariſt, to the Bodies of the deceaſed; the Grounds of theſe Practices are given by <hi>Zonara</hi> and <hi>Balſamon;</hi>

               <p>After this we muſt agree with <hi>Scaliger,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſput. 17.

               <p>It cannot be denied but that this white Garment is an Invention of <hi>Popery</hi> uſed in moſt, if not all their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip, hardly any Foppery is acted amongſt them, but this is in, nay, it is ever uſed in the very Act of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, for idolatrous Ends; hence one may judge how defiled it muſt be, but ſay they, amongſt <hi>Papists</hi> 'tis conſecrated, not amongſt us, as for that, it may as well be conſecrated as Altars, Churches and Church-yards, however we ought to <hi>hate even the Garment ſpotted by the Fleſh,</hi>

               <p>But to return to the Surplice, it is not only a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in it ſelf, but there is alſo a Ceremony in the uſing of it, for commonly after the Miniſter hath read, he puts it off before he goes up to the Pulpit, and if he comes down again to read at the Desk, for the Pulpit is thought no fit Place for that, then he puts it on again; though we ſee ſome to ſave themſelves the trouble of putting on and off, go in it up to the Pulpit, and after Sermon come down to read at the Altar what remaineth to be read, let them ſhew me any Profit thereby ariſing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Loſs of one Soul thorough Offence given: They ſay we have Tables, Table-cloths, and Bells, and take no Exception thereat, but there is reaſon upon the account of the Difference, for ſuch things are of a civil uſe, but Croſs and Surplice are not: <hi>Brightman</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which is very ſhort to Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi>'s Allegations for the Antiquity of diſtinct ceremonious Apparel uſed by Miniſters in their Miniſtration, may give a farther Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about this point.</p>

Would to God we had none of theſe heatheniſh Cuſtoms, as Maypols, Green Boughs at certain times of the Year, at the Windows of our Houſes, and in the very Churches; but two great Abuſes are committed about this Poſture of kneeling, the one moſt cruel, to deny the Sacrament to thoſe who believe in Conſcience they may not receive it in that Poſture: This, if the Party be otherwiſe well qualified, I look upon as unwarrantable, at leaſt the Poſture ought to be left indifferent; the other Abuſe is, that an Ordinance of God, inſtituted to be a Seal of the Pardon of our Sins, is made uſe of for a prophane End, namely, to qualifie a Man for civil Offices, for except he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the Sacrament kneeling, he ſhall not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any publick Place.</p>

                  </gap>, not only without, but alſo againſt Scripture; here is a Worſhip expreſſed by an outward
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41736:35"/>Act, bowing, which is not denyed, only they ſay, they worſhip not the Altar but God before the Altar, ſo <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> ſay, they worſhip not the Image but God before the Image, ſo the Jews might ſay, they worſhipped not the Golden Calf, but God before the Golden Calf; however in the ſecond Commandment God hath as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly as can be, forbidden to bow down before any Image or Likeneſs of any thing: This is performed in the Church, the Place appointed for God's Worſhip But this having more at large been handled elſewhere,<note place="margin">In the juſt and ſober Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> &amp;c.</note> I ſhall add theſe few Words, how there are different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Idolatry and Superſtition, whereof the very leaſt is carefully to be avoided: They who worſhipped the Sun and Moon cannot be excuſed from Idolatry, however 'tis not in ſuch a Degree, and ſo groſly as of thoſe that worſhipped Kine, Calves, Snakes, Crocodiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and rational Men will own it is a worſe Degree of Idolatry to worſhip Stock and Stones, than living Creatures which are God's Works, when others are Man's: Now indeed Idolatry committed by Chriſtians, as we all know <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, is more abominable than that of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, becauſe they ſin againſt greater Lights: So amongſt Chriſtians, they which know moſt, and are better acquainted with God's Will revealed in his Word, are more guilty than thoſe who know leſs, for they ought to act according to, and be guided by their Light: Was it a fair and Chriſtian-like thing for ſome <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> when they found that barbarous People unwilling to forbear worſhipping their Idols, amongſt them to ſet up Crucifixes, and then boaſt of that kind of Wit, how they had brought them to adore the Crucifix? A rate Mixture, and a fine trimming of Worſhip indeed, whereby they withal ſtrengthened them in their Idolatry; inſtead of removing their Idols, they only increaſed their Number with bringing a new one amongſt the old ones, though under a ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41736:35"/>of Chriſt crucified, but in matter of Worſhip all Pretences are not worth a Straw: Remove the Cauſe and the Occaſion too, do neither countenance nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it in the leaſt, if Altars be unto us a Sin, we muſt not make Altars to ſin, rather no Altars at all,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 8.11.</note> if they prove Snares: Falſe Ways are many, whileſt there is but a true one to pleaſe a God jealous of his Honour, namely, to make his revealed Will the Rule of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and no other.</p>
               <p>As to bowing in matter of Religion, it is an outward Act of Worſhip to be performed to him that is the true Object thereof, and to none elſe. <hi>David,</hi> under the Type of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeaking of the Kingdom of Chriſt, ſaith, they that dwell in the Wilderneſs <hi>ſhall bow before him;</hi> which two Verſes after he calls,<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.9, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> pay him that Honour which is due to God alone; ſo the very Act of Idolatry is expreſſed by the Name of <hi>bowing,</hi> which God, as already obſerved, doth poſitively forbid in the ſecond Commandment, and was after repeated, not only by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the very Words, <hi>nor bow your ſelves unto them,</hi>

               <p>But to conclude this Point, God forbid I ſhould charge the Church of <hi>England</hi> with Idolatry, for their bowing to the altar, I verily believe they know and do better, though the ignorant ſort of People are apt to entertain wrong Notions about ſuch things, but indeed I do not know how to clear them from the Appearance of it; they bow to an Altar as a <hi>Papiſt</hi> doth to an Image
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41736:36"/>and to a Crucifix, whether they make this the Object of their Worſhip, or do worſhip God before it, or before an Altar, the Lord alone the Searcher of the Heart, knoweth; neither can I clear them from Superſtition in their always bowing towards a certain Place and no other: All theſe Prejudices conceived againſt them, they might eaſily remove, if they would part with that Ceremony, in leaving it off there is neither Harm nor Danger, when there may be both in the continuing thereof: Can any rational Man deny it were better and more Chriſtian-like, quite to forſake it than to give Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to ſo many, and Occaſion of ſtumbling to ſome that are weak, and alſo Ground of Suſpicion, that if there be no Idolatry, there is at leaſt Appearance of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, which by all means ought to be avoided; this tends neither to Decency nor to Order, becauſe it doth not edifie, which ought to be the End of the other two; but notwithſtanding any Reaſon, they will keep it, <hi>nec poſſunt dicere quare,</hi> without any true ſound ground for't.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41736:41"/>Conſecration without any farther Ceremony, a Church and a Church-yard are never the better for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus conſecrated, wherefore 'tis vain and ſuperfluous to do it, 'tis appointed to an holy Uſe, but there is no inherent Holineſs, the true preaching of the Word, and the right Adminiſtration of the Sacraments are that which doth ſanctifie and diſtinguiſh it from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſe: If the Church is to be conſecrated, Why not the Pulpit? Why not the Bells? Which Papiſts baptize and have God-fathers and Godmothers for: So they do to Ships, ſo this Conſecration of Churches is not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture; an Imitation of Popery, and an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, unprofitable, and ſuperſtitious Ceremony, for ſome Men think the Church to be the better for it, or elſe they would not do it; nay, they think it to be no Church till it be done, for till then there is in it no preaching, at leaſt no adminiſtring of Sacraments, yet both they adminiſter in private Houſes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.5.</note> therefore in his Epiſtles to them he chargeth, exhorteth, and doth direct them how to

               <p>But we muſt leave off the Diſcourſe about Dioceſian Biſhops, and ſhall not meddle with it any further: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever let them not wholly engroſs to themſelves all Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Ordination, the whole Eccleſiaſtical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the ſole Right of Ordination, whereof the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, which is an eſſential Part of it, is called <hi>the laying on of the Hands of the Presbitery,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> which is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Body, not of one, but of many; ſo that for a Biſhop wholly to arrogate it to himſelf, is a great Abuſe, ſo 'tis though one or two more be called, if it be done <hi>pro formâ</hi> and for Faſhion ſake, which is an owning that that thing ought really to be ſo, though it be otherwiſe, like one who is made to ſign a Will or a Deed, and knows nothing of the Contents thereof: Indeed there is ſuch a Lordly Carriage amongſt ſome of them, as doth not become Miniſters of the Goſpel, who would not ſo much as ſay Grace at their own Table, but have their Chaplains to do it, nor to give a Viſit to the ſick, to comfort the afflicted, they have Worldy Buſineſſes to mind, beſides, that ſome uſe as Servants their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters; deſpiſing, or otherwiſe abuſing them in the ſame Degree, as they neglect their Flocks,<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note> whereby they become liable to the Judgments of God pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the Shepherds.</p>
               <p>But we leave that Point to come to the Abuſe of their Power in Convocation about Eccleſiaſtical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; as to the making of Canons and Conſtitutions, which if they pleaſe, may happen to be ſuch as will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger or bring the Nation under Bondage, and wrong Men in their Free-holds: Some of that kind have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41736:45"/>been made, and others have encroached upon thelegiſlative Power of the Nation; They who will take the Pains to peruſe the Records of that worthy Parliament in 1610, may find they took notice of ſuch Courſes as were contrary to the Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, condemned urging of Subſcriptions, above that appointed by the Statute of 13 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> only concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confeſſion of the true Chriſtian Faith, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacraments: Farther, Prelates kept their Courts in their own Names, ſilenced, deprived, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, which is to encroach upon the Crown's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and ſo thereby fall into the Penalty of <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> by the Statute of 25 of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. except they can ſhew ſome ſpecial Warrant by Statute for ſo doing, which they cannot, becauſe in King <hi>Edward</hi> the VIth's days they were ordered to keep their Courts in the King's Name: Canonical Oaths and Subſcriptions are Tyrannical Things, ſo are their more ſeverely puniſhing the breach of their Laws, than of God's; and to teach a neceſſity where Chriſt hath left a Liberty, is an effect of Arbitrarineſs: It cannot be denied but that ſeveral good and faithful Servants of Chriſt, for refuſing to ſubmit to Ceremonies which God never Commanded, but hath forbid 'em, have through mercileſs and unjuſt Perſecution been reduced to Want and Miſery, to pay Fines, be put in Priſon, where ſome dyed; good learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laborious Miniſters turned out for Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and others, ſcandalous and unfit, put in their place, only becauſe they Conformed; a ſign that they minded Conformity more than the main Duties of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for rather than to put in Nonconformiſts, they left Pariſhes unprovided: wear the Surplice or Preach not, Croſs or Baptiſe not, Kneel or no Sacrament for you; and the Miniſter Adminiſtring to ſuch, by the Canon to be ſuſpended. By their <hi>6th</hi> Canon Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts are accounted to be Schiſmaticks, Puritans, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41736:45"/>Excommunicated <hi>ipſo facto</hi> without Appeal. This is to make as great a difference between Proteſtants, and between Men and Men, as between Men and Beaſts; however, let us give praiſe to whom it is due. Biſhop <hi>Grindal</hi> was commanded to ſuppreſs an exerciſe called <hi>Prophecying,</hi> which he conſtantly refuſed to do: There hath been but few <hi>Grindal's</hi> in that point; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they turn'd out Preaching under pretence of Praying, or rather reading of Prayers.</p>
               <p>We look ſomewhat back; but certainly upon account of Nonconformity, here ſtrange things have been acted, not only of old, but alſo under ſome of the late Reigns, and the continued ſucceſſion of ſuch hard uſages have preſerved the memory of them, ſo that the ſmart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth laſt to this very day, and cannot eaſily be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: And though now, thanks be to God, Men live under the favour of an Act of Indulgence, and amongſt ſome Church-men who have more Moderation than others had, yet ſtill there are too many remaining that act by a Spirit of that kind, and if it was in their power would be as virulent as formerly others were.</p>
               <p>The Church was barbarouſly dealt with when perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by cruel tyrants and Strangers, as by <hi>Egyptians, Aſſyrians, Caldeans;</hi> but never more than when ſhe turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perſecute her ſelf, in her own Members:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we have, one amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and other good Men were put to Death, then when our Saviour, his Diſciples, and other Primitive Chriſtians were cruelly butchered, ſo always ſince when one part perſecuted another; then <hi>Popery</hi> out-did all that had been done before: And laſtly, here amongſt us, though not ſo cruelly, yet ill enough, as contrary to greater Lights, and againſt the Rules of Chriſtian Meekneſs and Charity; a ſign of a bad cauſe which makes uſe of ſuch means to promote it. In the mean time, the moſt important Concern hath been, and is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41736:46"/>ſtill neglected, in ſome parts of the Nation. At this very time I write, People have hardly a Sermon once a Month, no Miniſter in the place, upon occaſion to viſit and comfort the Sick; Livings are ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thoſe who live many Miles off, who come not near the place, and a poor Reader, or vicar, or Curate kept, who hath hardly Bread to put in his Mouth, the People are deprived of the Right of Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Approving, one fit or unfit is impoſed upon them; which is quite as unreaſonable, if not worſe, than if a Husband was preſſed upon a Woman whether ſhe will or not.</p>
               <p>Are not Biſhops concerned to look to and endeavour within their Dioceſs to remedy theſe Abuſes? When a Pariſh is worth 80 or 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year, and yet cannot have a Miniſter to live among them? In a word, for I am tired to think upon this ſubject, what ſhall we ſay of <hi>Chancellors, Commiſſaries, Officials, Parators, Purſuivants,</hi> and ſo many more Blood-ſuckers of the Church's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, of calling Miniſters without expreſs conſent of the Congregations, of Miniſters going to Law for their places, of Plurality, Non-reſidency, dumb Miniſters, Simony, prophane Contemners of Religion, Carnal proceedings in Spiritual Courts, taking Money for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, Citations, change of Penances into Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not theſe abominable Abuſes? This point I ſhall almoſt conclude with the Lordly and Pompous Prelate whom we have ſeen uſurping the ſole Authority of Juriſdiction, Ordination and Excommunication.</p>
               <p>But now we muſt ſpeak few words of his aſſuming wholly to himſelf the power of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> though ſome good may come by it, yet the thing in it that is good, might be done under another Name, which we would not borrow from <hi>Papists,</hi> through whoſe hands this is paſſed into ours, when they ſo ſuperſtitiouſly abuſe and make a Sacrament of it, but I will not inſiſt upon ſome things
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41736:46"/>I might ſay to the Purpoſe, only I muſt make an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, how ſtrange it is, that a Miniſter that hath a lawful Calling to preach the everlaſting Goſpel, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacraments, and hath a Right to do every thing elſe that belongs to the Office of Miniſtery, yet may not perform this Part of it which in Subſtance is to examin and Catechiſe Children, but this is reſerved for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: Thoſe are ſad Times when Will and Pleaſure have juſtled out Right and Reaſon, and when ſelling and buying, and ſuch like evil Practiſes turn the Houſe of God into a Den of Thieves.</p>
               <p>But this Point I ſhall conclude with an excellent Letter ſent to the Biſhops by Dr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> Preſident in <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Reader of Divinity Lecture there. It is thus. Your Lordſhip's Letters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto us by our Vice-chancelour, although writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in general Words, yet hath ſo hearted our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that now we are no more accounted Brethren and Friends, but Enemies: And ſeeing the old Maſs Attires be ſo ſtraighly commanded, the Maſs it ſelf is ſhortly look'd for; a Sword is now put into the Enemies Hands, of thoſe that under Queen Mary have drawn it for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and under Pretence of good Order, are ready, without Cauſe, to bewreck their Popiſh Anger upon us, who in this will uſe Extremity, in other Laws of more Importance, Partiality: I would, my Lords, have wiſhed rather privy Admonition than open Expulſion, yet I had rather receive Wounds of my Brother, than Kiſſes of mine Enemy: If we had privily in a convenient Day reſigned, then neither ſhould the Puniſher have been noted of Cruelty, nor the Offender of Temerity; neither ſhould Papiſts in their ſeditious Book have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed Proteſtants of Contention. Religion requireth naked Chriſt to be preached, profeſſed, glorified, that <hi>graviora legis,</hi> the moſt weighty things, by the moſt faihful Miniſtery of feeding Paſtours ſhould be further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41736:47"/>and after that, Orders tending to Edification, and not to Deſtruction, advanced, and finally the Spouſe's Friends ſhould by all means be cheriſhed, favoured, and defended, and not by Counterſeit and falſe Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, condemned, over-born, and defaced: But alas! A Man qualified with inward Gifts, for lack of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, how is he puniſhed? And a Man only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformable, inwardly quite unfurniſh'd, is let alone, yea, exalted; the painful Preacher for his Labour is beaten, the unpreaching Prelate offending in the greater is ſhot-free, the learned Man without his Cap is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the capped Man without Learning is not touched; is not this directly to break God's Law? Is not this the Phariſees Woe? Is not this to waſh the Outſide of the Cup and leave the inward Part uncleanſed? Is not this to prefer Mint and Aniſe to Faith, Judgment, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Man's Tradition before the Ordinance of God? Is not this in the School of Chriſt, and in the Method of the Goſpel a plain Diſorder? Hath not this prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Order a Woe? That the Catechiſm ſhould be read as the Word of God, it is the Order of the Church, to preach it, a neceſſary Point of a Prieſt, to make quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sermons is Law, to ſee poor Men of the poor Men's Box reliev'd, Vagabonds puniſh'd, Pariſhes communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, Rood Lofts pulled down, Monuments of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition defaced, Service done and heard, is Scripture, is Statute: That the Oath to the Queen's Majeſty ſhould be offered and taken, is required as well by Ordinance of God as of Man: Theſe are plain Matters, neceſſary, Chriſtian, and profitable; to wear a Surplice, a Coap, or a cornered Cap, is (as you take it) an accidental thing, a Deviſe only of Man, and as we ſay, a Doubt or Queſtion in Divinity; ſeeing then all theſe ſubſtantial Points are in all Places of this Realm almoſt neglected, the Offenders little or nothing rebuked, and ſeeing the Tranſgreſſors have no Colour of Conſcience, it is Sin
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41736:47"/>and Shame to proceed againſt us firſt, having alſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Defence of our Doings: Charity, my Lords, would firſt have taught us; Equity would firſt have ſpared us, Brotherlineſs would have warned us, Pity would have pardoned us, if we had been found Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſers: God is my Witneſs, who is the Beholder of a I Faith, I think of your Lordſhips honourably, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you as Brethren, reverencing you as Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: Alas! Why have you not ſome good Opinion of us? Why do you truſt known Adverſaries, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt your Brethren? We confeſs one Faith of Jeſus, we preach one Doctrine, we acknowledge one Ruler upon Earth, in all things, ſaving in this, we are of your Judgment, ſhall we be uſed thus for a Surplice? Shall Brethren perſecute Brethren for a forked Cap, deviſed ſingularly of him that is our Enemy! Now ſhall we fight for the Popiſh Coat, his Head and Body being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed? Shall the Controverſy ſo fall out in Concluſion, that for lack of this neceſſity Furniture (as it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) Labourers ſhall lack Wages, and Churches preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſhall we not teach? ſhall we not exerciſe our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents as God hath commanded us, becauſe we will not wear that which our Enemies have deſired, and that by the Appointment of Friends? O that ever I ſaw this Day, that our Adverſaries ſhould laugh to ſee Brethren fall together by the Ears; O that <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhould thus eat up <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh Ephraim.</hi> My Lords, before this takes place, conſider the Cauſe of the Church, the Triumphs of Antichriſt, the Laughter of Satan, the Sorrow and Sighs of a Number, the Miſery and Sequel of the Tragedy: I writ with Zeal, without Proof of my Matter at this preſent time, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge of it, nor without Grief of Mind: God move your Spirit at this preſent to fight againſt <hi>Carnem, Circumciſionem, imo, Conciſionem,</hi> againſt <hi>Literam &amp; Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,</hi> which principally is now regarded and rewarded:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41736:48"/>Speak, I humbly beſeech you, to the Queen's Majeſty, to the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> and to Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> and the reſt, that theſe Proceedings may ſleep, that <hi>England</hi> may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your zealous Mind towards the Worſhip of God, your Love towards the poor Well-willers, your Hatred towards the profeſſed Enemies, your Unity in true conformity, the other neither be needful now, neither exacted in any good Age, ſo ſhall the little Flock be bound to you, ſo ſhall the great Shepherd be good to you.</p>
               <p>There appears in this Letter a Sence of Piety, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and Chriſtian Reſolution, not to halt between two, but to ſuffer rather than to ſin, according to our Saviour's Rule, <hi>we cannot ſerve God and Mammon:</hi> When one is convinced of a Truth, he ought to adhere to it: Yet one Dr <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> who hath written for that Cauſe, would make us believe our bleſſed Saviour was a Trimmer, when in his Rejoynder he ſaith, <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our walked a middle Path between the Exceſs of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and the Preciſeneſs of the Sadducees, obſerving many ſignificant Ceremonies in Religion.</hi> The inſtituted Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies under the Law he fulfilled, but as to their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the Evangeliſts declare how ſmartly he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them; for certainly ſuch Expreſſions, to ſpeak of them as moderately as may be, ſhew a great Want of Reverence for our bleſſed Saviour; but thatStyle is no Stranger, with ſome of them, witneſs what Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſaith in his Defence. <hi>In</hi> Hezekiah's <hi>Time,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Idolatry about the Serpent could not be cured but by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Serpent, but in our moſt truly Reformed Church, which doth moſt lively expreſs the Face and full Body of her primitive Mother Church, this Diſeaſe would be found curable without any ſuch Extremity:</hi> Several things might hereupon be obſerved, againſt the Raſhneſs and ſtroug Preſumption of ſuch Writers who go about to blame that which God approveth; in this Man's Opinion, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:41736:48"/>was a ſilly Man who knew nothing, when he might have done much better, but trimming about God's Worſhip was not in faſhion in his time, yet he was a Prince, not wanting to ask Counſel of the Lord upon occaſion, as we read of he did after <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi>'s Blaſphemies; ſurely he acted not out of his own Head about the great Deſign of Reforming in the Beginning of his Reign, ſeeing he had ſeveral Prophets to adviſe with at that time, as <hi>Iſaiah, Hoſea,</hi> and <hi>Micah,</hi> he was one of the beſt Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> whom Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for running into ſuch an Extremity as to break in pieces the brazen Serpent, yet by the Dr's leave, the Spirit of God ſaith this is one of the things wherein <hi>he did that which was right in the Sight of the Lord,</hi> whether right or wrong, let the Diſpute be between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Doctor,</hi> but without any farther enlarging upon this, I content my ſelf with ſetting down an Obſervation which ſeveral Years ago an ingenious Man made upon the very Words: The meaning, ſaith he, is this, the Diſeaſe of Idolatry is more eaſily cured in that Church which doth lively expreſs the Face and full Body of thoſe Churches which were infected with many Errors, and declining in many things to Superſtition, than in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Church at that time moſt purely reformed.</p>
               <p>To vindicate our retaining a Traſh of Popiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, we could not but therein juſtifie that Party, and make uſe of their Words and Reaſons, but not being therewith ſatisfied, we go yet farther, and claim a near Relation with that Mother Church which the Word of God calls a Whore, and a great one too, and I wonder why we ſhould brag of being her Sons, and what Profit or Honour we may gain by owning in one reſpect or other to be deſcended from her? Yet it is too true we do it, it is ſtrange to ſee how fond ſome of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are of their Hierarchy, and what a Pother they keep about the Validity of Ordination and Epiſcopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, that to prove they have it amongſt them in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41736:49"/>a lineal and uninterrupted Succeſſion from the Apoſtles which is a very high Pretence, for they would ſome of them have their Prelacy derived from the Apoſtles; to make it of a divine Right, they muſt aſſert they have it by the means of Popiſh Biſhops, which is to plead the ſome continued Deſcent of Biſhops, as Papiſts do of Continual Succeſſors of <hi>Peter,</hi> and indeed 'tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee how the Author of the Conferences, troubles himſelf, and how much ado he keeps in the ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference againſt the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> to ſhew the Difference about the Validity of Ordination, and the Power of Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the Papiſts would have to be two different things, diſtinct and ſeparable ariſing out of a different Principle, but the other on the contrary would have them be together, and the ſame Act that conſerreth the one alſo to give the other, and therein great pains are taken to ſhew that this preſent Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is new, and much different of what it was before that time. 'Tis very true, one and the ſame Act doth confer both Ordination and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, but why to trouble one ſelf to quote a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Popiſh Authors, and to propoſe ſeveral Queſtions why ſome Popes did ſo and ſo? But to what purpoſe raiſe ſo much Duſt? And all this in ſpight of Papiſts, to affirm Ordination came to us by their means, as if the Ordination which is amongſt ſome forreign Proteſtant Churches, was not valid becauſe not derived from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Biſhops, which Communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince for theſe ſeveral Hundred of Years came to be ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly corrupt with Hereſie; Idolatry doth not deſerve the Name of a Church, for the true Doctrine of the Goſpel in many eſſential Points is not preached, nor the Sacraments, another true Mark of Chriſt's Church, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them; and according to the <hi>19th.</hi> of our 39. Art. the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church is no true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:41736:49"/>
               <p>But what then of all this Ordination? If we be ſo fond to have it of them, we muſt take it for what they give it and no more, that is, for a doubtful thing, in a word, that the Nation is on a ſandy Bottom, for Papiſts who make a Sacrament of it, ſay, the Efficacy, or its really being ſo, doth depend upon the Intention of the Prieſt, Biſhop, or Adminiſterer thereof: So then, if during that long and continual Succeſſion, one Biſhop had not an Intention to ordain ſuch and ſuch, then ſuch and ſuch ſo ordained, were not really ordained, and all ſince by them ordained, had no Ordination at all them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo could not ordain others: Now who can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our Biſhops that going back ſo many Degrees their Predeceſſors were intentionally and lawfully ordained: That ſome of them were ordained, without an Intention to ordain, it is very poſſible, and that the ſtricteſt Papiſts cannot deny; now they cannot give it better than they had it, and to ſpeak as modeſtly as can be, the Caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains doubtful, whether Ordination or no Ordination? Beſides, that ſome Cheats may happen to have ſtept in during Confuſions, pretending to have been ordained, though they never were: Now I ask, is it worth the while for an Uncertainty, and a doubtful thing, ſo much to ſtoop to or court the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church as to ſay, that whether they will or not, whether their Anceſtors had an Intention or no, yet we are their humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and have received Commiſſion and Ordination from them: When Water conveyed to us, is, through the Fault of the Pipes become corrupt, is it not not lawful for us to leave it off, and go to draw at the very Spring? So in matter of Ordination and Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel after ſuch an univerſal and abominable Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy and Corruption of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who will give no Bread without Poiſon, no Ordinance of God in its Purity and without inſufferable Abuſe and Depravation. Are we not allowed there to leave it and return to the firſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41736:50"/>Inſtitution, and purge the Filth of Human Inventions, Additions, and Defilement, have we not done ſo in matter of the Lord's Supper? Have we not done ſo in point of Baptiſm, who of us would receive the Lord's Supper after the Popiſh way, or have his Child chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all the Traſh and Fopperies by them uſed in Baptiſm? The like we may ſay of Ordination, when God was pleaſed in the time of Reformation, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner to reveal his Truth to our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; I do not ſay, they that had been ordained in Popery ſhould be reordained again, but for thoſe whom God raiſed to be Inſtruments to preach the Goſpel, ſhould they have gone to <hi>Babylon</hi> for Ordination where it was ſo corrupt? No, they betook themſelves to the firſt Inſtitution, and ſo ſettled a Miniſtry amongſt them as at this Day 'tis amongſt moſt forreign reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>But all this doth tend to unchurch all Proteſtant Churches beyond Seas that want Biſhops, becauſe for want of a right Ordination they muſt have no Miniſtry, thus their Miniſters muſt be Intruders, ſeeing they preach and adminiſter Sacraments without a lawful Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: So the Marriages they bleſs are but Concubinages, the Children they chriſten are not lawfully baptized; and to ſhew by Experience this is the Opinion of ſome here, have we not from time to time, ſpecially of late, invited and exhorted ſeveral Outlandiſh Miniſters to be, as actually they have been, reordained; and ſo we ſet our Hands to what Papiſts ſaid of them they were no Churches, a thing as uncharitable as unpolitick, for this hath been their only Way to get leave here to preach the Goſpel, and if a Popiſh Prieſt ſhould turn Proteſtant here, we would not ſo much as deſire him to be reordained, whereby we plainly own Popiſh Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be good, but that amongſt Reformed Churches not ſo. This is not the only Abuſe we have in theſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41736:50"/>Matters, if Ordination and Juriſdiction be together, and conferred by the ſame Act, why then are they ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſame Subject? We have ſeen lately a valid Ordination, deprived of the Power of Juriſdiction in the Caſe of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> which at other times hath alſo been the Caſe of others: 'Tis known how the King, as Head or Governour of this Church, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Infallibility, a Shaddow of a Pope, doth ſuſpend or command Biſhops and others to be ſuſpended <hi>ab Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi> or <hi>a Beneficio,</hi> and ſometimes of both, for in many of theſe things we are ſo fond of the Beaſt as to make uſe of his Language, as if the <hi>Engliſh Tongue</hi> was ſo barren as to want Words to expreſs ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Whileſt we diſown Reformed Churches to be true Churches, on the contrary, the Church, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Synagogue of Satan, and for all her abominable Errors in Doctrine and Practice, we muſt own to be a true Church, with ſaying, ſhe holds all eſſential Points of Faith, whence they take this Advantage, that then ſhe may not and muſt not be charged with Idolatry, which is an Errour, not only in Practice, but alſo in Judgment, for we believe, that as there is one God, and but one God, ſo he alone ought to be ſerved with a religious Worſhip, excluſively to every Creature, and 'tis ſad to ſee how to defend that <hi>Diana</hi> Hierarchy, and to ſhew how the Communion of <hi>Rome</hi> had Right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to our Biſhops a valid Ordination, and a Power of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction; we muſt, whether or not ſhe be ſo, make her a true Church, or elſe ſhe could not have conveyed it; but Papiſts do preſs on, either they have not all eſſential Points of Faith, which our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men grant they have, or elſe they muſt be cleared of the Charge of Idolatry: I ſay it again, 'tis ſad to ſee them reduced to Shifts as firſt to ſay, by that is meaned no more than that <hi>Rome</hi> owneth all the antient <hi>Creeds,</hi> when thoſe Creeds are but a ſhort Epitome of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41736:51"/>of our Faith, for ſeveral other things are implied therein, but expreſſed in ſeveral Parts of Scripture, out of which thoſe Creeds were compiled, and though they may be reduced under ſome of the Heads of theſe Creeds, yet they want Enlargement. Thus we ſee in the Time of <hi>Arrius,</hi> when he had publiſhed his abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſie, what Enlargements upon the Apoſtolical Creed, were made by the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> in their Creed, and that of <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> ſo though no new Creeds were compiled, when <hi>Neſtorius, Eutiches,</hi> and ſuch Arch-hereticks ſpread their Poiſon, the Councils aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled againſt them, made Canons and Enlargements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true Chriſtian Faith concerning thoſe Points: And as this ſheweth how the few ſhort Articles of our Faith contain more than they expreſs in relation to the Perſon of Chriſt; the like may be ſaid in Matters of his Grace, which were ſo fully and clearly enlarged upon by <hi>Auſtin, Proſper, Fulgentius,</hi> and other Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who did write againſt <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semipela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See farther what another Shift we make to come off, with ſaying, that the Commandments are no Articles of Faith: I well know the Diſtinction between things to be done, and things to be believed, ſo as to ſay, that to honour my Father and my Mother is not an Article of Faith, though it be a Rule of my Obedience: But that doth not hinder but that one and the ſame thing may be a Commandment and an Article of my Faith, and we ought not to attempt to teach God how to ſpeak in his holy Word. None may deny but that to have no other God before the Lord is a Commandment, and that not to bow down before the Likeneſs of any thing in Heaven, or in Earth, or in the Waters, is a Commandment, but alſo none muſt deny that we ought to believe there is one God, alone to be worſhipped and adored, which is the firſt Article of our Faith, when
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41736:51"/>alas, all theſe narrow Steps might eaſily be avoided, with laying by the Deſign of holding a Succeſſion of Ordination, and owning the Truth, in that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no Church, as wanting Purity and Truth of Doctrine and right Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, according to the Inſtitution, and ſtriking at the very Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of our Faith: We may juſtly call it, as our Lord calleth the Synagogue of Satan.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.9.</note> Some who called themſelves Jews, or the true Church, though that Name did not in the leaſt belong to them, So let our Friends to Popery, ſpeak of it all the good they can, as all the Evil againſt Presbyterians; the one ſhall never be a jot the better, nor the other the worſe for their talking againſt the Unreaſonableneſs and Injuſtice of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: We appeal to ſome of the true Sons of the Church, as none can deny Mr. <hi>Thomas Rogers</hi> to have been, in his Analyſis of the 39 Articles which he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the true Doctrine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, and dedicateth it to the then Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he doth not, as ſome others, ſlight forreign Churches, but brings in their ſeveral Confeſſions of Faith, to ſhew how they agree and concur with him in his Aſſertions, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places he gives them their due Title of Reformed Churches, and is not aſhamed to quote the <hi>Auguſtan, Saxon, Bohemian, Swevick, Helvetick, Baſil, Gallick, Belgick, Wittemb.</hi> &amp;c. Confeſſions to ſhew the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Conſent of all Proteſtant Reformed Churches, againſt that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now thoſe Churches are known to agree with <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> not only in Doctrine, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo about Church Government, Worſhip, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; yet none of them is ſo unjuſt, imprudent, and uncharitable, as to ſay they had rather to be Papiſts than Presbyterians and Diſſenters. Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> calls the forreign Churches our Godly Brethren in forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, pag. 103. and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> pag. 127.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:41736:52"/>
               <p>Thus, whileſt with one Hand we are hugging and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Papiſts, and as it were courting them to own a Relation of our Biſhops, being by means of Ordination, deſcended from theirs, on the other, Endeavours were uſed here to cruſh and deſtroy poor Brethren. Some, though Chriſtians and Country men, proved Wolves and Tygers againſt others. Nonconformiſts as were and are ſubmiſſive and obedient to Authority, who are for Order and Miniſtry, by way of Office in the Church, not guilty in the leaſt of any blaſphemous Doctrine againſt the Perſon, Offices, or Grace of Chriſt, nor of any Fundamental Errors, yet meerly for Conſciencce ſake, for nothing but <hi>Non-conformity</hi> was laid to their Charge; they were vexed, fined, caſt into Priſon, where ſome of them died, and otherwiſe cruelly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, which ought to make thoſe that have any thing of the Spirit of Chriſtianity to bluſh and be aſhamed: Such Practices ought to be left for the Children of him who is a Murderer from the Beginning: For cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and Heathen Emperors, and for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Anti-Chriſt, who by any means goes about to compel Men to believe their Opinions, to believe as they, ſay as they, and do as they do, a thing never practiſed by the Lord Jeſus, nor by his Apoſtles, nor by true Chriſtians, when they had the Power of the Sword: For Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the true Doctrines of the Goſpel, muſt not by Men be forced, but perſwaded, nor promoted by any violent ways; One Man may have a Power over the Body of another, but no Right or Authority over the Souls one of another, that's God's own Right and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and they are all Uſurpers that do encroach upon it.</p>
               <p>Reformation began firſt in <hi>Saxony</hi> under <hi>Luther,</hi> but there they neither kept nor did ſet up any Biſhops, nor have any ſuch Dioceſian to this very Day: but they have a Lay-man reſiding at the Elector's Court, commonly a privy-Counſellor called the <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery:</hi> and in thoſe Parts of <hi>Germany</hi> they have ſecularized ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

               <head>Of the Common-prayer-book.</head>
               <p>ONE thing more I muſt ſpeak of (though already this Diſcourſe be longer than at firſt I thought it would be) and that is, the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which I ſhall do as briefly as poſſibly I can: In order to it, 'twill not be amiſs to take notice how much that Space of Time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, between King <hi>Edward</hi>'s and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s had altered that Spirit which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reformation under that pious young Prince, the <hi>Joſiah</hi> of his time. That bloody Perſecution had deſtroyed the Lives of ſeveral of thoſe Godly and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inſtruments of Reformation under the former Reign, who in that great and good Work propoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves no Humane By-Ends, but only the Glory of God according to his Word; and though in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Days, there were ſeveral worthy Inſtruments, yet the Spirit they were acted by, was ſomewhat altered, if not in the whole, yet in part, as it will appear, if we compare the Articles as they were ſet forth in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Days, in the Year 1552, with the Edition which the Convocation under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in 1571 hath left us: There are ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Alterations in the Articles, as alſo in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer-book; what they are, for Brevity ſake, I ſhall not ſet down, yet I ſhall ſay they are about the Articles of Grace, of Juſtification, of Sacraments, of the Lord's Supper, and of Traditions: The Expreſſions left out of them hath proved ſome Detriment to the Truth, for they were ſtrong againſt ſome Errors that appeared ſince, and to confirm the Truths therein contained. But this in general may be obſerved about the Prayer-Book, how the Common-prayers are taken out of the <hi>Breviary,</hi> the Adminiſtration of Sacraments, Burial,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41736:53"/>Marriage, Viſitation of the Sick; out of the Ritual, the Conſecration of the Lord's Supper, Collects, Goſpels, and Epiſtles out of the <hi>Miſſal,</hi> and for the Book of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Pontifical. Two Popes, <hi>Pius 4th.</hi> and <hi>Gregory 13th.</hi> would have approved of it; if Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> had been content to have taken it from their Hands, and as to matter and manner they are ſuch as that when the <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Papiſts underſtood it was no other but the Maſs-book in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they were pacified about it: A ranck Papiſt, Dr. <hi>Carrier,</hi> ſaid, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-book and the Catechiſm contained in it, hold no Point of Doctrine expreſly contrary to Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Service, only it hath not enough in it. <hi>Conſiderat. pag.</hi> 45. <hi>ſect.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable how Secretary <hi>Walſingham</hi> hearing there was a Bull of Excommunication to come out againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> uſed a politick Trick to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it: He cauſed two of the Pope's Intelligencers, at the Pope's own Choice, to be as it were in ſecret brought over, and to them he appointed a Guide to ſhew them in <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> Service ſolemnly ſung and ſaid with all its Pomp; which Order the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Intelligencers ſeeing and admiring, they wondered their Maſter would be ſo unadviſed as to interdict a Prince or State whoſe Service and Ceremonies did ſo well agree with his own; ſo returning to the Pope, they ſhewed him his Overſight, affirming how they ſaw no Service or Ceremonies in <hi>England</hi> but what might very well have been performed in <hi>Rome,</hi> whereupon the Bull was preſently called in.</p>
               <p>The Prayer-book is the Beads of our high Church-People, for as Papiſts think all is well with them if they do but tell their Beads ſo many times a Day, hence it is that they look upon it as their great Work when they go to their Churches, where they mutter ſo many <hi>Pater
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41736:53"/>Noſters,</hi> or ſo many times the Lord's Prayer, and <hi>Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marias,</hi> or the Angel's Salutation to the Virgin: So we have amongſt us thoſe who think to have performed the whole Chriſtian Duty, if they do but go to the Service as they call it, and hear the Prayer-book read.</p>
               <p>Out of the Common-prayer-book, in that Part of the Litany, where it is ſaid, from Sedition and privy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, the following Words are left out, <hi>From the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and from his deteſtable Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi> I think after the bloody Tragedy acted under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> we had no more reaſon to leave out that important Truth, than they had before to have it in.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak ſomething more in general upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though within as narrow a Compaſs as I can; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by others much hath been ſaid to the Purpoſe. We declare we are not againſt Liturgies, other Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches have them, and we own they are Help up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Occaſion, wherefore we be wronged when traduced for Enemies to Liturgies, we love them full, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, and to the purpoſe, but not clogged with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Repetitions: 'Tis good to have a Form for Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, of the Lord's Supper, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Marriages, but they muſt not be too long nor too many, nor be a Hinderance for Miniſters to exerciſe the Gift of Prayer, or to make them neglect it, nor to juſtle out preaching; neither muſt Men make the publick Worſhip of God conſiſt only or chiefly in hearing Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers read. With theſe Cautions we approve well of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy; wherefore let it be known we except not againſt Liturgies in general and as ſuch, but in particular againſt ſuch as we think to have juſt Exceptions againſt, either as to the matter or to the manner of uſing them. As to thoſe Liturgies fathered upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Mark;</hi> they are ſpurious, and were obtruded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World by the Romaniſts.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:41736:54"/>
               <p>Although I do not intend to inſiſt upon thoſe Places of the Common-prayer-book which we have juſt Cauſe to except againſt, becauſe others have done it before, yet ſomething muſt be ſaid to it, and we muſt come to ſome particlars. I ſhall begin with the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> concerning the Order how the reſt of the holy Scripture, beſides the Pſalter, is appointed to be read; in the firſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph is a Brand and a Slight put upon holy Canonical Scripture of the Old Teſtament, for it is ſaid, <hi>It ſhall be read through once every Year, except certain Books and Chapters which be leaſt edifying, and might be ſpared,</hi> yet inſtead of theſe are read ſeveral of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, as <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom, 2d. of Eſdras, Baruch, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith, Tobith,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby a viſible Preference is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe Humane Writings, before the authentick Word of God, for they are lookt upon as beſt edifying and leaſt to be ſpared. In the point this is worſe than Papiſts who give the Apocryphas and their Traditions an equal Authority to Canonical Scripture, which is the Word of God, when the others are the Word of Man; but this, as I already obſerved, giveth the Preference to ſome of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> before ſome of the <hi>Canonical:</hi> I hope this ſhall be no Queſtion between us, we all know the Reaſons we have againſt Papiſts about the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Apocrypha. Firſt,</hi> They were all written after the Time of <hi>Malachy</hi> the laſt of the Prophets. <hi>Secondly,</hi> None of the Apocrypha is written in Hebrew which is the Tongue uſed by the Prophets. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither the Jews nor the primitive Apoſtolical Church ever received them as Canonical. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they were never quoted in the New Teſtament by our Saviour or his Apoſtles, tho there be Places quoted out of every Book of the Old Teſtament, and our bleſſed Saviour mentioned the Old Teſtament under three Heads, <hi>The Law of Moſes, the Prophets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 24.44.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Pſalms:</hi> But the <hi>fifth</hi> and chief Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in every thing they do not agree with the Canonical
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41736:54"/>Scripture, nor with themſelves, as hath been ſhewed by ſome of our Divines, as <hi>Whitaker, Reynolds,</hi> &amp;c. ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Body of Divinity; and by Forreigners, as <hi>Polanus, Chamierus,</hi> and ſo many more: And this I preſs the more becauſe the Authority of it in Scripture is one of the Fundamental Points of our Religion, and one of the greateſt Controverſies between Papiſts and us.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Paragraph of the ſame Rubrick 'tis ordered thus, <hi>as often as the firſt Chapter of St.</hi> Matthew <hi>is read, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Leſſon or Goſpel, ye ſhall begin the ſame at Verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>and the third Chapter of St.</hi> Luke<hi>'s Goſpel ſhall be read unto the middle of Verſe the 23d.</hi> Surely that which is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be left out is Part of Scripture as that which is read; the one as well as the other are written for our Inſtruction as well as Comfort: That which is unread is of a high Concernment, for though it conſiſts only of proper Names, yet contains a moſt important Matter, every Degree of our bleſſed Saviour's Genealogy, which God under the Old Teſtament took ſuch Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve clear, that when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came to be born, there ſhould be no Doubt, no Difficulty made of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the Family of <hi>David</hi> which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> proves on <hi>Joſeph</hi> his ſuppoſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſide, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> on <hi>Mary</hi>'s; the firſt divided into three Claſſes of 14 Generations, every one of which makes undiſputably a great Article of our Faith, how Jeſus Chriſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is the true Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah promiſed to the World out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and then the mention amongſt Chriſt's Anceſtors made of <hi>Thamar,</hi> of <hi>Rachab,</hi> of <hi>Ruth,</hi> of her that had been <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Berſheba,</hi> whereby Chriſt owns for his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the Fleſh, ſome branded with notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faults, others, though Aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, to ſhew how in his Spiritual Relations he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41736:55"/>would not diſown the moſt notorious Sinners and never ſo much Gentiles: This I ſay affords matter of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo is not to be unread.</p>
               <p>Here followeth the Table of the proper Leſſons to be read; at the Head whereof we find the Word <hi>Mattens</hi> for Morning Prayer, and to have matched things well, there ſhould have been the Word <hi>Veſpers</hi> inſtead of Evening Song; both Words in that Sence uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom we borrow both Names and things, as we ſhall have Occaſion farther to ſpeak of, now theſe Words are derived from Latin and uſed in <hi>Italian, Spaniſh, French,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis no wonder if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken things out of their Latin Books, we alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome of their Names, as <hi>Advent, Epiphany, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quageſima, Sexageſima, Septuageſima,</hi> &amp;c. which are barbarous to every Engliſh Man unacquainted with the Latin Tongue, or with the Cuſtoms of that Church, ſo we do continue their Maſs Names and Days, as <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> the Day when Maſs is ſaid for the Birth of Chriſt, <hi>Candlemaſs,</hi> the Day of the Maſs of Candles, for then Popiſh Churches are full of them; <hi>Lammas</hi> Day, the Day when here in Time of Popery they ſaid Maſs for the Preſervation of Lambs, <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> the Day when <hi>Michael</hi>'s Maſs is ſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſay no Maſs upon thoſe Days, but we have Collect, Epiſtle, and Goſpel, ſome of which <hi>Papists</hi> uſe upon thoſe very Days.</p>
               <p>Now, if we look into the <hi>Kalender,</hi> we ſhall there find the Names of many Saints which either were never in Nature, or elſe are honoured upon Earth, when may be their Souls are tormented in Hell, <hi>Boniface, Silveſter, Clement, Dunſtan, George, Martin, Denis,</hi> for there muſt be Champions to defend the reſt, ſpecially the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as <hi>Margaret, Agnes, Magdalene, Katharine, Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> &amp;c. and to be merry, <hi>Cicely</hi> the Patroneſs of Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, with <hi>Nicolas, Criſpin, Blaſius,</hi> Patrons of Seamen, Shoemakers, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:41736:55"/>amongſt other <hi>Inventions</hi> that of the <hi>Croſs</hi> muſt be in too, <hi>Remige</hi> and ſeveral other Popiſh Saints, whoſe Names ſhould not be in our Mouths, much leſs in our Common-prayer-book; we muſt not omit how there are five Holy Days for the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>Purification, Annunciation, Viſitation, Nativity,</hi> and <hi>Conception,</hi> there ſhould have been alſo her <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> when ſhe was, as they pretend, carried up to Heaven in Body and Soul, then we could have all the Papiſts keep for her, when alas I defie them all together to prove any of thoſe Days to be the Day which they keep it for. ſo then they are kept at a Venture: What ſhall we ſay of the Names of <hi>Rogations, Ember Week,</hi> and ſo many more to be found in our Prayer-book, which are the Quinteſſence of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Superſtitious Holy Days. What I ſay is not in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the civil Part of thoſe Names, but as to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as they are brought into the Church. But they will ſay, we keep not all ſuch Dayes, there is only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number mentioned after the <hi>Kalender,</hi> but I ask wherefore then do you ſet them down, yet there are Mornings and Evenings, <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Leſſons for the very Day which I make no doubt are read where Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is every Day. In the ſame Kalender we find the faſts as well as Feaſts, and thoſe Faſts are always upon the <hi>Eves</hi> of certain Holy Days, which are many, only I find St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> have none, whileſt <hi>All Saints</hi> have, wherein a Partiality appeareth; we have <hi>Good Friday, Holy Thurſday,</hi> no better nor holier than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whole <hi>Lent,</hi> &amp;c. But this matter of Feaſts and Faſts I have ſpoken of before.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt of <hi>May</hi> is the Feaſt by Papiſts dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> but we are ſo fond of the Latin Tongue, that becauſe <hi>Jacobus</hi> is the Latin for <hi>James,</hi> in the Payer-book 'tis called <hi>Jacob</hi> and not <hi>James.</hi> I know no other Reaſon why it ſhould be ſo, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath a greater Affinity to the Latin, the Latin
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41736:56"/>Church we ſtill retain a Kindneſs for. After the Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are certain Notes belonging to it, whereof one is, that the <hi>13th.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> is to be read until ſuch Words. The Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> hath but 12. Chapters in all, and muſt the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> againſt which, as an <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> are lawful Exceptions, be fathered upon that holy Prophet, and be inſerted into his Book as a Chapter of it?</p>
               <p>In the Morning and Evening Prayers, when the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Confeſſion is read by the Miniſter, it were well for the People within themſelves or with a very low Voice to follow him; but ſo loud as uſually it is, is not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but makes a Noiſe and Confuſion; for the ſame Reaſon the Anſwers that follow the Lord's Prayer, which indeed have very little Relation, if any at all, with what goeth before or what followeth: In Prayer the Miniſter is the Mouth of the People to God, and the People with their Hearts are to joyn with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in his Prayer, as with Reverence and Attention they ought to hear when he is God's Mouth to them, that is, when he preacheth. I might take notice of what is ſaid there of ſinging the Leſſon in plain Tune, to ſing the Collect, Epiſtle, and Goſpel, which are very improper things: So of their <hi>Benedicite, Magnificat, Nunc dimittis,</hi> which I ſuppoſe might admit of Engliſh Names, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter; as for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers at the latter End, they contain good Expreſſions, but ill applied without a Connexion between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, all after the <hi>Romiſh</hi> way, which 'tis to be wiſhed we had not ſo much of as we have, we could well enough be without it as without thoſe Portions of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphas</hi> when we are wanting ſomething for Inſtruction, Comfort, and Edification, which the Word of God may ſupply us with. 'Tis not enough to ſing our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but our Creed and Confeſſion <hi>of Faith muſt alſo be ſung, as ordered in the Evening Prayer</hi> upon ſome certain
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41736:56"/>great Days therein named. We grant that 'tis well to have thoſe ſeveral things in Verſes to uſe them; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver herein Men ought not to allow themſelves oto much Liberty, for the Word of God ought always to be handled with a great Reſpect and Reverence, the Tone of our Voice ought to be adapted to the Matter, and the Occaſion according to that Rule of St. <hi>James;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 5.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray; is any merry? Let him ſing Pſalms:</hi> Prayer and Singing are different Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be uſed upon ſeveral Occaſions, as are Affliction and Mirth.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed farther, one thing I muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, which to me ſeems unaccountable, that is, the uſing of the Word <hi>Prieſt</hi> in our Prayer-book. In the two Places I quoted before,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.11. 1 Cor. 12.28.</note> whereunto we may joyn <hi>Rom</hi> 12, the Apoſtle mentioneth the ſeveral Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church, but there is no ſign either of the Name or of the Office of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> under the Law there were ſome, becauſe Sacrifices were to be made, but under the Goſpel no Sacrifice but of Prayer and Praiſe we have the <hi>Eucharisty,</hi> or Commemoration of our Lord and Saviour's Sacrifice upon the Croſs, but that's good for Papiſts to have <hi>Prieſts</hi> who pretend daily to make an Expiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the Living and of the Dead, but we abhor ſuch a thing, at leaſt pretend to do ſo: We ſay we aboliſh the thing, and yet retain the Name; the Name of Miniſter is in Scripture known in this Sence;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 44.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Let a Man ſo account of us as of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the Myſteries of God:</hi> The Names <hi>Biſhop, Paſtor,</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> are known in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but if they think the Word Miniſter below them, which I charitably believe they do not, becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though ſeldom, they uſe it, then they may uſe the Word <hi>Elder</hi> or Presbyter which is the Greek for Elder,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls himſelf, and <hi>Presbytery</hi> are Scripture Names ſignifying Office in the Church, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41736:57"/>there is a great Difference between <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Presbyter</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> which is the proper Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the laſt, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.6. ſo then the Word Prieſt is fetched afar off, and there is no ſuch Office in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Litany</hi> the ſame may be ſaid by the People at the ſame time with the Miniſter, but with a low Voice and not not after and ſeparately; they do it after the manner of the <hi>Kirie Eleiſon</hi> uſed by Papiſts; here the People, not the Miniſter make the Prayer, for they and not he, ſay, <hi>Spare us good Lord: Good Lord deliver us. We beſeech thee to hear us good Lord.</hi> When 'tis ſaid <hi>from Fornication and all other deadly Sin,</hi> the Word <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> doth favour the <hi>Popiſh</hi> erroneous Diſtinction of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> and <hi>Venial</hi> Sins: They hold but ſeven Mortal Sins, whereof Fornication is one, but they hold there are Sins of their Nature not mortal, and which do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Death, which is contrary to the whole Courſe of Scripture,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.20. Rom. 6.23.</note> which ſaith expreſly, <hi>the Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die,</hi> and <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> This may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be mended with changing the Word <hi>deadly</hi> into any of theſe <hi>groſs, horrid, enormeous,</hi> or ſuch like, which to deny is certainly to refuſe Peace upon eaſie Terms; to pray againſt <hi>Lightning</hi> is as good as to pray againſt Rain, Snow, and the like; by thine <hi>Agony,</hi> too much like an Oath. The Word <hi>gracious,</hi> meaned of King or Queen, is not proper in a Prayer to God, who knoweth whom we mean without ſuch Titles; in Prayer the Attribute <hi>moſt gracious,</hi> which is a ſuperlative Degree, is not well applied to Princes, we can ſay no more to God, and as good to call moſt holy King; there ought to be a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Titles given to God, and thoſe given to Princes, ſpecially in Church at the Worſhip of God: In God's Sight they are but Men, and the Lord is jealous of his Honour and Glory which he declared he will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to any one. Let Men keep flattering Titles
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41736:57"/>when they ſpeak to Princes, though I think none but due ones were better; but in Prayers to God let Names of Blaſphemy be avoided, which we all condemn in the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Farther, it were well to forbear the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unneceſſary Repetitions of the ſame thing which in this Litany and other Parts of the Book are frequent, and thoſe broken Parts of Scripture which have no relation one to another, all might be made up into one Prayer, and not be divided into ſo many: Then in one of the Prayers 'tis ſaid, <hi>Turn from us all thoſe Evils that we moſt righteouſly have deſerved:</hi> We think the Word <hi>justly</hi> is more proper the other being ambiguous; Juſtice and Righteouſneſs do differ.</p>
               <p>Now for the Collects, there are many for ſeveral Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days in <hi>Advent,</hi> and ſo many after <hi>Epiphany</hi> and <hi>Trinity,</hi> an odd Way of reckoning the Lord's Days by; in that on St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Day, God is prayed to grant us to learn by the Example of St. <hi>Stephen.</hi> The Name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a ſtrong Argument, and ſufficient to prevail with God, if any can, ſo that of any Man is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but there is a Day appointed to be kept for that Martyr, and upon it ſomething of him muſt be ſaid, but we take a great deal of Pains more than the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in his Time, who appointed no Day for him. Who gave the Name of <hi>Innocents</hi> to the Children killed by <hi>Herod</hi>'s Order? They confeſſed not with ſpeaking but with dying, and becauſe they were put to Death to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>Herod</hi>'s Policy and State Jealouſie, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low they died either Confeſſors or Martyrs, they did not lay down their Lives for the Teſtimony of the Lord Jeſus, for they were not able to know and diſcern. Why to obſerve the Day of Chriſt's <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and not of his Baptiſm? No Man, as I obſerved before, can ſay for certain the Day of any ſuch Feaſts they keep, why to keep <hi>Epiphany</hi> or Twelft Day, ſo much turned to Exceſs in Popery and amongſt us too? None of theſe produceth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41736:58"/>Decency nor Edification; I think amongſt Chriſtians in our publick Devotion book as the Liturgy is: The Words Lord's Day or Sabbath were more proper than Sunday,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> having as we have a Warrant out of Scripture: This is the Way of reckoning after Popery, I pray God we be not called to an Account for too much following after them: As to obſerving Days for the Apoſtles, I know of no Warrant we have to believe God is pleaſed with it, on the contrary, nor of the <hi>Purification</hi> of the bleſſed Virgin which is but a Continuation of a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony, all which are or ought to be aboliſhed under the Goſpel. As to the Collect, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>thine only begotten Son was this Day preſented in the Temple,</hi> it containeth either a Lie which no Man can diſapprove, or at leaſt an uncertain and doubtful thing, there being no Certainty of the Day: If by <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel or Prince of Angels, be meaned our Lord and Saviour, for the Name <hi>Michael</hi> ſignifying, <hi>who is like unto thee O ſtrong God,</hi> is appliable to him, then he hath his Day called the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Day; if <hi>Michael</hi> be an Angel, then he is a Creature, ſo not to be joined with the Creator, and no Days to be kept for Angels, there being no Warrant for it in Scripture. Honour, the Angel would receive none.<note place="margin">Rev. 19.10. and Chap. 22 9. Pſal. 16.4.</note> As for <hi>all Saints</hi> Days 'tis a Shame, a Day for all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Saints; with <hi>David</hi> we ſhould ſay, <hi>I will not take up their Names into my Lips.</hi> As for the Apoſtles, whilſt alive, they never thought nor deſired to have Days kept for them after their Death. St. <hi>Paul</hi> the zealous Aſſerter of Mercy, and ſworn Enemy to any thing of Merit in Man, would never have approved that a Day ſhould be kept for his <hi>Converſion,</hi> he ſufficiently declares againſt obſerverving of <hi>Days,</hi> Months, and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> which makes him ſay,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.10, 11. 1 Cor. 1.12. and Chap. 3.5. 2 Cor. 4.7. Rom. 9.21.</note> 
                  <hi>I am afraid of you leaſt I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon you Labour in vain:</hi> he would have ſaid, <hi>Who is</hi> Paul? <hi>Who is</hi> Apollo? <hi>Who is</hi> Cephas? <hi>But Miniſters or Servants, Earthen Veſſels,</hi> And <hi>a Lump of Clay in the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41736:58"/>Potter's Hand;</hi> whileſt alive, when Inſtruments in God's Hand, but much leſs are they after their Death, he would have ſaid what are they? that Days ſhould be kept for them, and for himſelf? Which once was a Perſecutor, a Blaſphemer, and the chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>After this followeth the Order for the Adminiſtration of the Communion, there in the Beginning of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> we read of the <hi>Curate,</hi> and in other Places of <hi>Vicars</hi> and ſuch inferior Limbs of Hierarchy, whereof not the leaſt Step in Scripture. If Prayers be appointed to be read in the Chancel for Conveniency of Reader and Hearers it's well, but if upon any Opinion of Holineſs or other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the Place then 'tis ill, for that Place is no better than any other in the Church; but why the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould ſtand on the North Side of the Table, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for Conveniency, I ſee no Cauſe, for the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtood on the North Side of the City, but now we ought not to ſtand upon ſuch Points of the Compaſs. The People ſaying after every Precept, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> &amp;c. is ſuperfluous, ſpecially with a loud Voice, once after the laſt, as we humbly conceive might be enough:<note place="margin">Matth. 6.7.</note> Chriſt forbiddeth to uſe vain and unneceſſary Repetitions, for Men are not heard for their much ſpeaking: It may be obſerved that the two Prayers for the King are improper upon that Occaſion; it ſuppoſeth a Communion without a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon before, inſtead of which <hi>an Homily to be read,</hi> which is better than nothing, but there ought to be a Preparatory Sermon, except in Caſe of Accident, or elſe the Miniſters are encouraged to Lazineſs and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and uſed to read rather than to preach. After Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Homily the <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Curate is to declare unto the People,</hi> Popiſh Cuſtom ſtill, <hi>whether there be any Holy-Days the Week following, and if there be,</hi> what? <hi>To ſhut their Shops and give over working for the Day.</hi> By a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41736:59"/>Commandment of God the Week is divided into two Parts, <hi>ſix Days to labour</hi> which many ſeem not to take notice of, <hi>the ſeventh is the Sabbath to keep it holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this are heaped one upon another Sentences which have no Connexion with themſelves, nor Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the preſent Occaſion; the thing therein moſt plain is, that the People ought to make Proviſion for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and that is preſſed in five Paragraphs, ſomething indeed is afterwards ſaid for the Poor, but the gathering is, for fear of miſſing, made before the Communion, when without Diverſion, People ought wholly to be taken up with Meditation upon that high Myſtery; it were more proper after the Action to gather: But men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of <hi>Offering Days,</hi> a Device at firſt of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy to ſatisfie their Covetouſneſs, ſo that <hi>every Man and Woman ſhall pay to the Curate the due and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Offerings,</hi> which is a meer unhandſome Trade in the Church, as if one ſhould ſay, there is ſuch a Rate ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy Sacrament which muſt be paid before you receive it, for it is ſaid there, <hi>after which done,</hi> that is, the Money laid down, and not before, the <hi>Prieſt ſhall ſay,</hi> that is, ſhall go on, this tendeth to neither Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Order, or Edification, rather to Scandal. If our bleſſed Saviour was upon Earth, here now as much as as ever, he would have Cauſe to turn out many who make Simony and Merchandiſe in and about the Church,<note place="margin">Matth. 2.12. Joh. 14, 15, 16.</note> as he did formerly. But to go on, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Prayer a <hi>third</hi> time mention is made for the King: We as much as they can be, are for praying for Kings and Superiour Powers, but every thing ought to have its Time and Place, if you will obſerve Order and Decency, once is enough, afterwards our Thoughts ought to be taken up with higher things, with the King of Kings.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41736:59"/>
               <p>Before the Confeſſion in the Rubrick a Difference is made between the <hi>Miniſter</hi> and the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Confeſſion ſhall be read by one of the Miniſters or the Prieſt himſelf:</hi> By the Miniſter may be is underſtood the <hi>Reader</hi> or the <hi>Clark</hi> under the ſame Name; here is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Office in the Church different from the Prieſt's: Thus in Convents and Monaſteries, Papiſts have <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brothers, Moncks</hi> and ſerving <hi>Fryers,</hi> for theſe to do what the others think to be below themſelves, and the Drudgery: Then the Dialogue between Prieſt and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not very proper, it might be done without Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. Of two Prayer juſt before the receiving of the Communion; one is to be ſaid (or read, for every thing is but reading) kneeling, the other ſtanding, why in a different Poſture? After the Prayer the Miniſter may riſe and conſecrate. In the <hi>Glory be to God on high,</hi> is ſaid thrice in the ſame Words, <hi>thou that takeſt away the Sins of the World,</hi> &amp;c. In the Lord's Prayer ſuch Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not to be found, if it be in relation to the moſt holy and bleſſed Trinity, we have other Ways to do it than with ſuch Repetitions: Laſt of all there is this Clauſe, <hi>and yearly at Eaſter every Pariſhioner ſhall reckon with his Parſon, Vicar, or Curate</hi> (no ſuch Diſtinction in Scripture) <hi>or his or their Deputy or Deputies, and pay to him or them all Eccleſiaſtical Duties;</hi> a Sabbath and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Day very improper to give in and caſt up Accounts, a Day or two before or after might be fitter, but this I muſt not inſiſt upon to come to more material things.</p>
               <p>We now muſt come to publick Baptiſm, and I cannot forbear taking notice of a thing in the very Beginning, <hi>It is not convenient Baptiſm ſhould be administred but upon Sundays or other Holy Days:</hi> Here Holy Days ſo called are equal with the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Lord</hi>'s Day, when a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ought to be made between What God hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and what Men have invented; this ſtrikes at the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41736:60"/>Morality of the Sabbath, wherof the keeping is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the firſt Table, ſo that Men may as well murder, commit Adultery, ſteal, even take the Name of God in vain, as to break the Sabbath: Whoſoever makes no Scruple to break it, will make no Conſcience of any thing in Religion. The Queſtions asked of Godfathers and Godmothers with their Anſwers in the Child's Name, are unbecoming ſo holy and ſo ſerious a Matter; to ſay, <hi>to forſake the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. to believe and to deſire to be baptized, by the Mouth of thoſe who without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace cannot do it for themſelves, a Child who can neither hear nor ſpeak, is deſtitute of the Uſe of Reaſon, 'tis a manner of jeſting with and profaning that holy Sacrament: Then followes the aerial Sign of the Croſs on the Forehead, which one may accidentally happen to make when he puts Flies out of his Face; this Sign ſaith the Prieſt is made in Token that hereafter he ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt, and this as good as the Godfathers Promiſe to forſake the Devil, for he is poſitive <hi>he ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> Something that followeth we except againſt, namely, <hi>theſe Children be regenerate and graſted,</hi> &amp;c. which is repeated in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Prayer, <hi>We yield thee hearty Thanks, that it hath pleaſed thee to regenerate this Infant with thy holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Somewhat lower I ſhall give my Reaſons; laſt of all 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Miniſter ſhall command;</hi> here is a Magiſterial, and I thought it had been but a Miniſterial Authority, <hi>that the Children be brought to the Biſhop to be confirmed of him,</hi> &amp;c. This makes Confirmation an Appendix to the Sacraments, as if it had not perfectly been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, but ſomething had remained to be added to it.</p>
               <p>In the manner of Adminiſtration of private Baptiſm are ſome things which I obſerved before: This private Baptiſm ſeems with Papiſts to argue an abſolute Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sacrament which we deny, when Men have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41736:60"/>done what they can to bring the Child to Baptiſm, and God through Sickneſs, Death, or otherwiſe alloweth it not, then Men muſt ſubmit to his holy Will: other things there are which in the following Head I ſhall take farther notice of.</p>
               <p>This Point of <hi>Confirmation</hi> is that which followeth next; at the Beginning of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> is ſomething that needs being explained, for though the Words be clear, the Sence is not, theſe are the Words, <hi>to the end that Confirmation may be miniſtred to the more edifying of ſuch as ſhall receive it according to St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Doctrine who teacheth,</hi> &amp;c. This ſeems to intimate as if Confirmation were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s doctrine, but no ſuch thing as this Confirmation is to be read in his Epiſtles; Prayer and laying on of the Hands may profitably be uſed upon Children, but ſuch an Act needs not to be called Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which Papiſts make a Sacrament of, and uſe it to the ſame purpoſe. Laſt of all this is ſaid, <hi>he,</hi> any Man, <hi>ſhall koow for truth that it is certain by God's Word, that Children being baptized have all things neceſſary for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and be undoubtedly ſaved:</hi> Nothing more Poſitive than this can be ſaid upon a Matter: In the two foregoing Heads ſomething there was to this purpoſe, to ſay it once ſhould have been enough, but twice is too much; again, to ſay as if by Baptiſm the Child had been infallibly adopted, <hi>&amp;c. for our Lord Jeſus doth not deny his Grace and Mercy to ſuch Infants;</hi> this is too poſitive, how can he tell it? One may charitably believe it, yet not be true, the ſame Caution muſt be obſerved in the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation following, <hi>doubt ye not therefore but do earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that,</hi> &amp;c. If this was by way of prayer as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to regenerate, to receive into the Number of thy Children this Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if it was ſaid we charitably believe, it would be well; but to ſay ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, that it is certain by the Word of God, but no ſuch thing in the Word of God; on the contrary,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41736:61"/>this ſets up two Popiſh Errors, <hi>firſt,</hi> Neceſſity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to Salvation, as if one could not be ſaved without it, hence they exclude from Heaven Children that die without Baptiſm, the <hi>ſecond</hi> Errour, that the viſible Sign doth confer the inviſible Grace, ſo that whoſoever is baptized, <hi>opere operato</hi> is thereby regenerated: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever eats the Bread and drinks the Wine, eats and drinks the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are good Rules ſet in the Rubrick about Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, as asking of the Banes three ſeveral Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> which well obſerved would prevent abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Miſchief by unlawful Marriages; in the Words and Form it may be well till the Ceremony of the Ring put upon the fourth Finger of the Woman by the Man after it had been laid upon the Book with the Money due to the Miniſter and Clark; indeed amids the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration 'tis very undecent to bring in Money which might better be done before or after the Bleſſing, but they will make ſure of their Fees. Then the Words ſpoken when the Ring is put upon the Finger, <hi>With this Ring I thee wed, with my Body I thee Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. are unbecoming that holy and ſolemn Inſtitution; it ſeems the Ring is made eſſential to the Marriage; then joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together the right Hands, why the right rather than the left called that of the Heart? The Miniſter may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Words, but plighting the Troth, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hands are idle Ceremonies too much like a Play, whether or not they be ſignificant, though neceſſary for the Miniſter as the Ground of his declaring them Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife: The ſaying or ſinging a Pſalm when going to the Communion Table, then the Anſwers after it, even the Communion at that time is not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, neither repeating the Prayer after what was ſaid in the Beginning that Marriage ſignifieth unto us the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Union of Chriſt with his Church: All Forms of that Nature muſt be ſhort, full, and becoming the Gravity and Majeſty of the Ordinance.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:41736:61"/>
               <p>Concerning <hi>the Viſitation of the ſick,</hi> thoſe Anſwers at the Beginning do much ſmell of the Popiſh Prieſt, who hardly goes about any Part of his Office but always hath with him his Clark to anſwer at Maſs and elſewhere: Surely upon this Occaſion it ſhould be left to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Miniſter to uſe his Gift of Prayer according to the Nature of the Diſeaſe, to the Shortneſs or Length of it, and the Temper and Condition he finds the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in by Diſcourſe and Converſation, firſt with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Exhortations ſuitable with that State he finds him in, and after with Prayer, 'tis ſtrange that upon ſuch Occaſions a Miniſter ſhould be only <hi>doctus in libro,</hi> and very ſad he can or muſt not pray, comfort a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nor hardly preach or execute any other Part of his Miniſtry without Book; then 'tis not poſſible to pen a Prayer that at all times and Places can reach every Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Caſe: The ſpecial Confeſſion required of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is too much like Popery, but the following Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſt is very ſtrange amongſt Proteſtants, ſpecially theſe Words, <hi>and by the Authority committed to me I abſolve thee from all thy Sins:</hi> Upon Condition of Repentance a Miniſter may declare a Sinner abſolved, but not abſolve him; theſe are the very Words uſed by Popiſh Prieſts, <hi>by Chriſt's Authority committed to me,</hi> how hard is it to walk upon the burning Coales and not burn his Feet? And though the following Prayer be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and fit for the Occaſion, yet after a poſitive Abſolution of all Sins, it is prepoſterous, and had been better placed before. Now to ſee a Miniſter coming into a ſick Man's Room with a Book in his Hand, is the true Poſture of a Popiſh Prieſt upon ſuch an occaſion ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it.</p>
               <p>About the <hi>Burial of the Dead:</hi> We ought upon this account to be very ſhy, not to do any thing ſeeming to favour Popiſh Errors about the dead: The Truth is what in that and ſome other things we do, we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <p>All this was extracted out of a prayer-book printed in 1645, but in that now uſed which was publiſhed in <hi>Charles</hi> II's Days, we find ſome Alterations, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than in the Former. In the preface are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome uncharitable and unjuſt Reflections againſt Nonconformiſts called <hi>Men given to Change, who always diſcovered a greater Regard to their own private Fancies and Intereſts than to that Duty they owe to the publick,</hi> and

               <p>In the proper Leſſons is a Feaſt called <hi>Annunciation of our Lady,</hi> it is not ſufficiently expreſſed by the Name of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but <hi>our Lady:</hi> Seeing they come upon thoſe Terms, they ought to have ſaid which of the Ladies, either of <hi>Egypt, Loretto, Monſerrat,</hi> and fifty more without <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> which we could name, for they are all Ladies, with Churches dedicated to, and Days appointed for them: The Word <hi>Lady</hi> is not enough, 'tis common to ſo many, though in the Word we read of one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but of no Lady, ſhe ſhould have been called <hi>Queen of Heaven,</hi> and thoſe great Titles given her in her Litany. In a due and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent manner we honour her Memory, and call her the moſt bleſſed amongſt all Women, but not in a Popiſh and Superſtitious Way. In the <hi>Kalender</hi> we are taught to reckon the Month after the Roman Way by <hi>Nonae, Idus,</hi> and <hi>Calend,</hi> but to what purpoſe, they know beſt? In the manner of ordering of Prieſts, and conſecrating of Biſhops, we have <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> for thoſe Words in <hi>Latin</hi> have a greater Emphaſis and Energy than in Engliſh, but not in ordering of Deacons, that is uſed in the <hi>Conclave</hi> in the Election of a <hi>Pope</hi> which brings Infallibility in the Election;<note place="margin">Acts 24.23. and 1 Tim. 4.14. and 2 Tim. 1.6.</note> when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> ordered Elders or Miniſters in every Church they prayed, faſted, and laid Hands upon them without any other Ceremony. I ſhould have ſaid how their Way of Service in Cathedrals depriveth People of the Comfort of ſinging Pſalms.</p>
               <p>But we muſt return back to the Kalender, there in red Letters we find King <hi>Charles Martyr,</hi> and the <hi>29th of May,</hi>

The Service for <hi>Charles</hi> II's Birth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, as to the Occaſion, Matter, and Manner, is a fit Match for this, all alike. I remember, one thing I ſhall mention now we ſpeak of Kings, and that's about Coronation, wherein are obſerved ſome meerly <hi>Popiſh</hi> Fopperies which make <hi>Weſtminster Abbey</hi> ſo much like a Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> or upon ſuch an Occaſion any Popiſh Church elſewhere, the manner of laying the <hi>Regalia</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar, the bowing and cringings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I ſhall only ſpeak of the anointing, an idle Ceremony now, formerly a Jewiſh one; anointing of Prieſts, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Kings, under the Law were Typical, all end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who yet, though a Prieſt, a Prophet, and a King, was not anointed with Oyl, but with the Gifts and Graces thereby ſignified; our Miniſters or Prieſts as they call them, ſhould alſo be anointed as well as our Kings, in this and that certain Parts of the Body, rather than in another; it is pity but that to perform ſo ſolemn an Action, we ſhould alſo have a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Bottle of Oyl brought down from Heaven, or a <hi>St. Ampoul,</hi> that's never diminiſhed to anoint our Kings, as the <hi>French</hi> pretend to, as alſo, till now, they imitated them in touching for the King's Evil, however anointing may not be ſaid to be eſſential to the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now to the manner of uſing the Prayer-book: Why ſhould the Miniſter read one Verſe and the People with a loud Voice another, which is againſt Decency, and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule not to ſpeak all at once? Why ſhould the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41736:64"/>
                  <hi>Doxology</hi> Glory be to the Father, be repeated ſo often as well as the Lord's Prayer? And why ſo divided as that the Miniſter ſhould ever ſay one Half and the People the other? Like <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Clark</hi> in <hi>Popery,</hi> this to anſwer for the other: Why ſhould the Title of every Pſalm be Latin? Why is <hi>Simeon</hi>'s Song called the <hi>Nunc dimittis?</hi> The bleſſed Virgin's to be known under the Name of <hi>Magnificat,</hi> when we ſpeak of the Rich Man to call him <hi>Dives?</hi> Why <hi>Simon</hi> rather <hi>Magus</hi> than the Sorcerer? If we be ſo fond to call things by Names in an unknown Language, let it be in Hebrew or in Greek which are the original Tongues of Old, and New Teſtament, and not in Latin, which with their Decrees is the Language of the Beaſt; if in Engliſh we wanted Words to ſignifie things, then there would be Cauſe to borrow of others, but we are not brought to ſuch Streights; every one knows how all the Popiſh Service is in Latin, wherein we ſtill hold a Communication with, and in ſome kind own a Dependency upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with uſing her Language, nay, we ſeem ſo fond of it, that we uſe it alſo in Law, a <hi>Bond</hi> and ſome other Deeds are in Latin, which is a ſhameful Subjection, as if they were our Maſters whoſe Tongue we ought to ſpeak: When <hi>England</hi> was ſubject to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> there was ſomething to ſay for it, but now nothing at all, except we have a mind to go back to <hi>Rome;</hi> all that can be pleaded for, 'tis an old Cuſtom and an evil one too, to be left off: But much having by others been ſaid upon the matter, I ſhall no further enlarge upon it, only as to the manner of uſing the Prayer-book. This particular I ſhall add concerning the Word of God read ſometimes ſtanding and ſometimes ſitting: But if to ſtand at the reading of God's Word be a more reverend Poſture than to ſit, why do they ſit when the Epiſtle is read, and ſtand when the Goſpel is? Surely there is for this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence not the leaſt Shaddow in Scripture, the Epiſtle is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41736:64"/>as much the Word of God as the Goſpel; but they not only make Epiſtle to differ from Goſpel, but alſo Goſpel from Goſpel, for at the ſecond Leſſon they ſtand when ſome Part of a Chapter of the Goſpel is read, and yet they ſit when a whole Chapter is read in the firſt Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; what's the meaning of all this? One Part is read with more Reverence than the whole, for when that very ſame Chapter, out of which the Part is taken, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to be read at the firſt Leſſon, People doth ſit, and is a greater Reſpect to be ſhewed at the reading of the ſecond Leſſon than at the firſt? To me this ſeems unaccountable.</p>
               <p>But a thing there is which I muſt not omit taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, being liable to a juſt Exception, though not in the Common-prayer-book: At the latter End of moſt of our old Bibles is a Form of Prayers for private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in that for the Evening are theſe Expreſſions, <hi>That all the World may know that at what time ſoever a Sinner doth repent of his Sins from the Bottom of his Heart, thou wilt put all his Wickedneſs out of thy Remembrance as thou haſt promiſed by thy holy Prophet.</hi> But, no Prophet ſaith ſo;<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.21.</note> we know they ground it upon the Prophet who in God's Name declareth that a holy penitent Sinner ſhall live: Three things are here to be obſerved, <hi>firſt,</hi> That turning and Repentance, upon which Life is promiſed, is not in the Power of Man, but a ſpecial Gift of God: The <hi>ſecond,</hi> That the turning therein mentioned is upon a legal Bottom, for he ſaith, <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his Sin that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live.</hi> To keep all God's Statutes is impoſſible for Men, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there is nothing but what the Law ſays, <hi>do this and thou ſhalt live,</hi> thus our Saviour doth interpet it,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.17.</note> 
                  <hi>if thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> thing here to be obſerved, and upon which I ground what I ſaid, is, That in the Place there is no ſuch thing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41736:65"/>as, at what time ſoever, nor nothing equivalent, nor in any other Prophet, for out of ſuch a Text if there was, the wicked would take Encouragement to continue in Sin to the laſt, now Scripture preſſes Sinners not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay Repentance; we know ſome ſay they can repent when they will, but God never ſaid ſo in his Word; thus, though this be not in the Prayer-book, yet I bring it under that Head.</p>
               <p>Now after this to ſhew we are not ſingular in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning theſe Points, we will back our Reaſons with the Evidence of ſome few eminent Inſtruments of Reformation, pious and learned Men both abroad and at home;<note place="margin">Calvin Epiſt. and Protect.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> is the firſt Forreigner in his Letter to the <hi>Lord Protector</hi> in good King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, he ſaith thus, <hi>I come to the other Head about aboliſhing and plucking up by the very Roots Abuſes and Corruptions</hi> which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <q>in Ages paſſed hath brought into God's Ordinances, it is evident that the Chriſtianity or Religion of <hi>Popery</hi> is Baſtardy and falſe; wherefore if we reſolve to bring the People out of that Gulf, we muſt follow the Apoſtle's Example, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. from whence it is generally taught, that when Men would reform as they ought to do, and acceptably to God, they muſt then betake themſelves to the pure Word of God, for ſee how many Mixtures which Man's Brain hath hatched do remain; ſo many Pollutions are there which diſtract Men from the right Uſe of thoſe things which he hath appointed for their Salvation: Wherefore, while ſuch a Sink as that is but in the Part pumpt out, things cannot be ſaid to be as they ſhould be, ſpecially when Religion appeared rather masked than ſincere and with open Face, which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore note, becauſe I perceive many now a-days are of another Judgment, as if petty Abuſes were to be let alone as long as groſſer matters be removed, whereas contrariwiſe Experience it ſelf ſhews what a fertile Soil and faithful Seed-plot of Lies Man's Invention is, that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41736:65"/>being but thin ſowen, as it were with leſſer Grains, groweth to ſuch an Heap as if his Meaſure did intend nothing elſe: Now the Scripture is far different from this, when <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of Idols, he profeſſeth their Name ſhould not go in or out at the Door of his Lips, to ſhew extream Deteſtation; let us remove our Foot as far as we can from the Snares of Satan, for what were all thoſe Ceremonies but ſo many whoriſh Enticements to let ſilly Souls into Miſchief, yea, even Snares to catch Men in? But if we talk that the People may be warned leaſt they ſtumble, yet notwitſtanding who doth not behold Men hardned by them: So little doth that Warning avail to any purpoſe: Therefore if any ſuch thing be left untouched, it will be but the Foment and Fewel of greater Miſchief, and very blind, ſet up to hinder ſincere Doctrine from all Entrance as were fit.</q> In his <hi>ſecond</hi> Epiſtle he exhorteth the ſame Protector to help <hi>Hooper</hi> who ſtood againſt thoſe Foppiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; this is all we ſhall for the preſent make uſe of out of him, though abundance more might be produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beza</hi> is the next, he often ſpeaks much to our Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſpecially in the Place mentioned before, now quoted in the Margent, not to be repeated here in his Annotations upon theſe Words,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23,</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are bought with a Price, be not ye the Servants of Men?</hi> He condemneth thoſe that contrary to that Part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do preſs ſuperſtitious Rites upon the Conſciences of Men, and from <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.20. he demonſtrates how Man's corrupt Nature is too much inclined to looſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and ſubmit to Superſtition, which with <hi>Seneca</hi> we may well call, <hi>inſanus Error,</hi> a mad Error, which Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Ceremonies are Breeders of; to give them their due, they are the Burthens of the Church, the Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh of God's Ordinances, the Scourge of good Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Brood and Hopes of Popery, the rejoycing of the Prophane, the Grievance of the Good, and the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41736:66"/>Seed of Diſſention, ſo then it is an unwarrantable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to bring them in; the Caſe can be no better illuſtrated than with the Parable in the Goſpel, where the Lord Jeſus is ſaid to be <hi>like a Man taking a far Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> comes next, who though a Divinity Profeſſor at <hi>Oxford,</hi> yet was a Forreigner born, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth the Miniſters of <hi>Poland</hi> to keep ſuch Order in the Adminiſtration of Sacraments, as differeth moſt from the Toys and Ceremonies of <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and if from the <q>Heart we hated Superſtition, certainly we would do our Endeavour clean to put out and deface all the Footſteps and Monuments thereof: Further he ſaith, there is ſomewhat more hard I confeſs of thoſe Garments they call holy, and which ſomewhat troubleth me that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are ſo ſtrictly retained;</q> and he himſelf refuſeth to wear the Surplice, for he ſaith, when I was at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> I would never uſe thoſe white Garments in the

               <p>The <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> Confeſſion ſaith, it is not lawful ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſtore the old Ceremonies of the Law, or to deviſe new ones to ſhadow forth the Truth already laid open, or brought to light by the Goſpel, as in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſet up Candles to ſignifie the Light of the Goſpel, or to carry Banners or Croſſes to ſignifie the Victory of Chriſt thorough his Croſs: 'Tis added, no myſtical Rites which carry ſome Myſtery or Signification in them, though not otherwiſe impious (as namely, ſuch as ſhould be Parts of God's Doctrine or kind of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) but only becauſe ſuch Laws as belong to Order and Decency are lawful: But why any longer to ſtand upon ſome particular Evidences, we have with us a whole Cloud of Witneſſes, for beyond Sea, <hi>Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Bullinger,</hi> to whom ſome Letters from <hi>Lady Jane Grey</hi> are to be ſeen at <hi>Zurich, Danaeus, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deel, Chemnitius, Zeſperus, Mullerus, Chamier, Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> &amp;c. beſides ſome we named before, and all I ſhall conclude with ſeveral Paſſages of that excellent Epiſtle a purpoſe and by Order from the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> by <hi>Zanchius</hi> written to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which doth begin thus.</p>

                  <q>Moſt Gracious and moſt Chriſtian Queen: We have not without Grief underſtood that the Fire of Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about certain Garments, which we thought had been quenched long ago, is now again, to the incredible Offence of the Godly as it were ariſed from Hell, and kindled afreſh in your Majeſties Kingdom, and that the Occaſion of this Fire is becauſe your gracious Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded by ſome, otherwiſe great Men, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41736:67"/>with a Zeal (but certainly not according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) to retain Unity in Religion, hath now more than ever before, reſolved, yea, doth command that all Biſhops and Miniſters of the Church ſhall in Divine Service put on the white and linnen Garments which the popiſh Prieſts now uſe in Popery,—to the perpetual Diſgrace of your renowned Majeſty,—which thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, I ſee not how your gracious Majeſty can with good Conſcience propound again the Garments in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and other things of that kind, ſmelling as yet of popiſh Superſtition, and once baniſhed out of the Churches, to be taken on again,—and therefore all things are to be called back, as much as may be, to the Rule of God, and to the Former and Apoſtolical, and to the more pure and ſimple Form of Religion. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if as the Apoſtle commandeth, we are to abſtain, not only from all Evil, but from all Appearance of Evil, to what End I beſeech you, moſt Renowned and moſt Godly Queen, ſhould thoſe things be brought in again into the Church of God by the Prince's Commandments which are contrary to the Gravity of the Apoſtolical Worſhip, which ſmell of the popiſh Superſtition, which do not ſerve to the Edification of the Godly, nor to Order, nor for Ornament, except that which is whoriſh which laſtly can bring no Profit, but on the contrary, many Evils to the Church, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> For though they be not evil or unclean in their Nature, yet becauſe of the former and late Abuſe, they are not altogether free from Uncleanneſs; certainly it cannot be denied but that at leaſt they will give Occaſions of many Evils, and very grievous Superſtitions; now the very Occaſions alſo of Evils are to be avoided.— This is to tempt God.— We ought, moſt Religious Queen, to have nothing to do with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in matter of Religion, ſave in thoſe things which they have common with the Apoſtles: Why? I beſeech you, were ſome things

This recalling of ſuch popiſh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will be a greater Evil, then peradventure it may be ſeen even to the very wiſe Men at the firſt Sight,— therefore to recal theſe ſtinking Garments and other Rubbiſh of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church into the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at this time, what is it but to give Papiſts an occaſion, and the beſt that may be, to confirm and harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs in their Superſtitions, and alſo to help them therein?— And who knoweth not that theſe Garments are a Part of the Houſhold Stuff of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Seducer, and to bring them into the Church of Chriſt, What is it elſe but to provoke God to Anger, and to kindle his Fury againſt us? And though the Epiſtle deſerves wholly to be tranſcribed, yet not to be too tedious, I ſhall ſhorten it: He calls thoſe Garments, unknown to the Chriſtian World in the Times of the Apoſtles and of the Apoſtolical Men, Garments of Godleſs Prieſts, and Slaves of Antichriſt.— So aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly by the arguing of things indifferent to trouble the Peace of Churches, and to cauſe Strife between good Men and bad, yea, between good Men themſelves, is ſo wicked, that it can by no means be defended.— If your gracious <hi>Majeſty</hi> deſireth, as you would, to ſeem Apoſtolical, then in this matter imitate the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: Neither lay and impoſe this Yoke upon the Neck of Chriſt's Diſciples your ſelf, nor ſuffer others to do it.— For all Men know that moſt part of all the Churches that are fallen from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Goſpel's Sake, not only have left off, but alſo abhor thoſe Garments.— 'Tis in vain to hope in ſo doing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41736:68"/>to bring in <hi>Papiſts</hi> over to us, who can never amend their Doctrines, nor part with their abominable Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and Idolatries; then ſaith he, this woundeth the Conſciences of private Believers, a tender Conſcience that feareth God, is a moſt precious thing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him, for if theſe things be impoſed as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, we do ungodlily, becauſe we make thoſe things to be neceſſary which Chriſt would have to be free, if indifferent they ought to be left free.</q> Theſe are the ſame Arguments we uſe, but here we leave off, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have done enough to ſhew the Sence of that Learned and Famous Divine upon ſo ſolemn an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

               <p>In every thing we perform about Religion, it is our Duty to obey Ordinances, and uſe the means which God hath appointed; God indeed can work without, but we have no warrant to think he will: In this caſe we are ſure to be tied by a Commandment, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged

It is a Sin not to do well, and to do ill, Ignorance excuſeth, though not from the whole, yet from the meaſure of Puniſhment, but in thoſe who ſin againſt Knowledge, namely, that God hath not commanded, but rather forbidden ſuch things, 'tis a double Sin and with a Witneſs, many Stripes for the Servant who knows the Maſter's Will and doth it not, and I think we may truly ſay, no Nation was ever more ſeverely puniſhed than the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> becauſe they ſinned againſt greater Lights, 'tis not enough to know the Truth, but alſo we muſt obey it.</p>
               <p>This whole Diſcourſe I can no better conclude than with ſome few Obſervations upon the <hi>14th.</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> I wiſh it to be read more than it is, and what is therein contained better obſerved, for it doth juſtly fit and reach our Caſe, the whole being reduced to the great Rule of Charity;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41736:74"/>great I may call it,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.10.</note> for <hi>it is the fulfilling of the Law:</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity now a-days is much talked of, but little practiſed; we are all agreed about the Speculation and Theory, but the whole Difficulty lies in coming to the practicable Part thereof: Which that it may be well, ought to be univerſal, in every thing we do according to that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.14.

                  <hi>Let all your things be done with Charity;</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it will never do if Men ſtand upon Punctilios and Niceties, and ſay tell us (which hath been told a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times) what ye would have, and in caſe we think fit to grant you ſome of the things you deſire, will you joyn with us as to the reſt? This is pertinaciouſly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a barren and unprofitable Ground, and this kind of Capitulations do not become the truly noble Spirit of Chriſtian Religion, ye keep the Doors ſhut upon us, do but level all the Rubbiſh of out-Works, thoſe Humane Buildings to make way for us to come into the Body of the Church, which whether we come or not, 'tis your Duty to do, and that once being over. you have done your Part, and if after it we do not come in, you may lay the Blame at our Door, but not only you keep Men from Church, but alſo ſtop all approaching to it, you ſhut them out of the Places that are accounted the Springs of Learning, as <hi>

               <p>Well, this by the by, but to come to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth not to deſpiſe or condemn one another for things indifferent, he inſtanceth it in two things that may ſerve for all of the ſame Nature, namely, eating

               <p>And yet thoſe things which the Church account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be indifferent, and we unlawful, are preſſed and impoſed upon as if they were moſt neceſſary, in as much as the thing relateth to my ſelf, muſt another Man's Conſcience or my own be a Judge in the Caſe? In our Churches and Worſhip we have nothing amongſt us which our Adverſaries may be offended at, or take Exception againſt: The Cauſe of Diviſion, the Idol of Jealouſie is amongſt them, let it be put away and then we will be all one; but if they prefer thoſe Human Inventions before our Union with them, if they have rather to keep us out than to part with their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherewith we cannot ſtand in the ſame Bottom; they ſay they can be without their Ceremonies, and we ſay we cannot be with them; after that let God and impartial Men judge where the Fault lies, who, they or we do hinder a neceſſary Union and Reconciliation which would prove ſo ſweet and ſo comfortable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and many Thouſands of Souls, to the greater Glory of God, ſtrengthening of the Proteſtant Intereſt, and weakening the Enemies thereof both abroad and at home: The Contrary of theſe doth but foment Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and Partialities, keep up Diviſions, encourage and give Advantage to our common Enemy, and if for Peace ſake we ſhould grant them what they ſay of us, namely, that it is Weakneſs in us that we cannot come up to them, which we in Conſcience cannot do, though they in Conſcience may do what we deſire of them, then let them know,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.1, 2.</note> how <hi>they that are ſtrong ought to bear the Infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe themſelves, but let every one pleaſe his Neighbour for his Good, to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Now when the Contrives of former Miſchief againſt Religion, are removed from the Throne and round about it, we have a happy Opportunity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and ſettling a deſirabale and longed for Union which we heartily deſire to the end that all Prejudices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>The Worſt in ſome of thoſe Men, is that when they want Proofs, they revile and abound in abuſive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to my great Grief, we find it in thoſe that ſeem to be or to have been moſt moderate among them, ſuch is the Author of thoſe Conferences we had elſewhere Occaſion to mention, though otherwiſe a Perſon of Worth and Learning, who under the Name of a Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Chaplain introduces one as the moſt nonſenſical Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the World, but he like the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> was ſure not to ſet a right Edge to the Weapons of the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The Fanatick Chaplain's Arguments muſt be laid down flat upon their Back: Indeed it had been well for him to have ſaid whom he meaneth by <hi>Fanatick</hi> and Fanatick Chaplains, though in the Book it appears enough whom he means, in ſuch Diſputes as this, Reaſons and not Injuries ſhould be made uſe of, 'tis a bad Cauſe that uſes ſuch means to defend it ſelf. We own there are Fanaticks in the World, but Men muſt not be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory as magiſterially to Father it upon thoſe who are no ſuch Men; they are Fanaticks as before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who are wholly guided by Fancy under the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Inſpirations and Lights of the Spirit different from, and contrary to the revealed Will of God, who feed upon meer Appearance, and bare Imaginations, but that Name doth not belong to thoſe who make the Word of God the Rule of their Faith and of Divine Worſhip, to retort, we ſay it belongs to thoſe which make their own Inventions the Rule thereof.</p>

               <p>There is another thing which indeed upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I cannot avoid taking notice of, how that Author flies out againſt the Writer of the Book called <hi>Patronus bonae fidei,</hi> in few places, ſpecially <hi>Pag.</hi> 231. where he uncharitably and unjuſtly charges him with Rage and Madneſs, and not to be endured in a chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who art thou that judgeſt another Man's Servant? I confeſs I am concerned to ſee that worthy Perſon ſo unworthily abuſed; if alive, he now could have defended himſelf; thereby I judge the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor knew him not, if he did, may be only by Relation, and not ſo well as I. He had I confeſs, ſome Notions and few Opinions, which as I ſometimes as a Friend ſaid to him, I did not approve of, nor could joyn with him in, but they did not concern the Fundamentals of Faith or Chriſtian Religion, only Church-government, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worſhip, and Ceremonies, in ſome of which he was in the right; as to all Eſſentials, very ſound as far as I could find by him, but as to Practice, Life, and Converſation, in my Opinion, one of the beſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteſt Men that ever I knew: As to what is ſaid, that his Friends, that is, a Brother, aſſiſted him, I muſt ſay, he did nothing for him, but what before he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, yet that which he gave being mixed with chidings, brought him no great comfort: Once he ſhewed me a Letter from that ſame Brother, wherein he would have ſaſtned upon him thoſe very Words of <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon, Thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act 8.23.</note> 
                  <hi>and in the Bond of Iniquity;</hi> becauſe he went a different Way from his, and I am ſure thoſe Supplies for a while were ſtopped, but whether for altogether I cannot tell for certain: Thus far I think my ſelf bound to vindicate his Memory. His Words that make that Author ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him, as to ſay, <hi>like a mad Man he leaves him to his Keeper,</hi> namely, that <hi>Egyptians</hi> pretended ſome Ground for their Idolatry, as that an Ape, a Cat, or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41736:77"/>a Wolf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had ſome Participation of the Divinity, but thoſe that bow down to a Wooden Table are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Stocks. Theſe Words I ſay deſerve not ſo hard a cenſure as is paſſed upon their Author.</p>
               <p>Here I intended to have made an end, but before I do I am bound to take notice of a thing now come to my Mind, too common abroad, a Token of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and uncharitableneſs of ſome of our Adverſaries, and a clear Demonſtration of their Love for and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Popery, take it as it followeth.</p>
               <p>Amongſt thoſe that are ſo poſſeſt with a Spirit of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Perſecution, are ſome ſo depraved in their Judgment, or ſo perverſe in their Hearts, or both, that to expreſs their perfect Hatred againſt thoſe who in ſome things diſſent from them, they openly ſay, they had rather to be <hi>Catholicks,</hi> for that's the Name which out of reſpect they give <hi>Papiſts,</hi> than <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as they are pleaſed to call them, and <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> That which is bred in the Bone, never goes out of the Fleſh, there is in their Hearts ſtill, ſomething of the Nature and Seed of that elder Siſter the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that ſavoureth the Ambition, Tyranny, and the deſire of the Exerciſe of an abſolute Authority over the Souls and Conſciences of Men, which all that oppoſe muſt be Fanaticks, but they ſhould know that Names ſignifie things, and ought not to be given but to thoſe whom the things by the Names ſignified do belong unto, otherwiſe they be miſapplied; we are guided neither by our own Fancy, or that of others, nor are <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theuſiaſts</hi> led by Dreams, Viſions, and meer Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I leave every impartial Man that hath but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sence and Reaſon to judge whether ſuch a Name be proper for thoſe who make the Word of God the only Judge of the controverted Queſtions, and will be by their Reaſon directed no longer than it is ruled by holy Scripture, the Judge of all Controverſies in Matters of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41736:77"/>Religion: The Malice of ſuch doth not ſtop here againſt us in theſe preſent or late Times, but they go back and would faſten upon the Perſons, tread under Feet the Aſhes, and unworthily defame the Memory of the firſt and eminent Inſtruments of Reformation, with all the ill Names and Words their Malice can invent, making them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, paſs thorough <hi>evil Report,</hi> as better Men than they, do thorough good, a thing as unhanſome as can be, let them ſpeak to the living, and ſome will be able to anſwer for themſelves, when none of the dead can. Theſe Men, like thoſe whom the Prophet ſpeaks of, encourage themſelves in an evil Matter. They commune of laying Snares. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.5.</p>
               <p>Then they had rather to be <hi>Papiſts</hi> than <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or <hi>Independents;</hi> they need not to ſay ſo, or expreſs themſelves in thoſe Terms, but 'twere more proper for them to ſay they are Papiſts more than Presbyterians, and then they will ſpeak the Truth, and to the purpoſe, for ſuch amongſt us are Papiſts under the Cloke of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, Spies, and Emiſſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to work Diviſions, Animoſities, and all poſſible Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, to promote the Intereſt of that Antichriſt; who would not refuſe to take a fat Abbey if they were reſtored among us, though they were to ſay Maſs for it, much leſs <hi>Palliums, Patriarchs, Cardinals</hi> Caps, and the reſt of the proud Titles and Dignities of that Antichriſtian Hierarchy: All theſe according to ſuch Men's Principles could eaſily and with Pleaſure be ſwallowed up by them, and theſe are ſuch grievous Wolves entered in amongſt us, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, and our bleſſed Lord had foretold before.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew we can never enough abhor ſuch Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe for a Proteſtant to ſay, I had rather to be a Papiſt than a Presbyterian, he who talks at ſuch a rate muſt either be a Papiſt indeed, or ought to be looked
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41736:78"/>upon as ſuch: Every Papiſt muſt own and believe the Fundamental Points of their Religion, which by them are thought neceſſary to Salvation, and which daily they are brought to believe and to practiſe, and none but Papiſts will believe thoſe Fundamental Errors wherein all Proteſtant and Reformed Churches do differ from them: on the other ſide, to ſay ſo, argues a very great Ignorance, of what Popery and Presbitery are, as indeed it is common amongſt ſome of our ordinary Sort of People, which like Parrets in a Cage, have learned the Name they often heard repeated unto them by ſome of the Church's paſſionate Teachers, who will as confidently affirm <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> to be the Doctrine of the Church, though never ſo falſe, and who ſometimes have been heard to complain how the firſt Reformers went too far, they might have ſpared ſeveral things and not have been ſo rigid, to have preſerved Union with the Romiſh Church, and not made an abſolute renting from it; doth not a ſenſible Man believe that Men of ſuch Principles will be ready, when it doth not croſs their Worldly Intereſt, to meet half way with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſuch, no Reaſon can cure, the very Springs of their Souls are corrupt, the Diſeaſe is paſt Recovery, without the immediate working of God's Spirit, wherefore I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe that are ſuch.</p>
               <p>But to the unlearned that are impoſed upon, and that ſin out of Ignorance, I ſhall give Reaſons to inform and Satisfie their Judgments; no Man may with himſelf to be of a Church, except he already be a Member of it, that believeth, ſuch Fundamental Errors which a Man dying in cannot be ſaved, and doth pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Idolatry, if Scripture ſaith Truth: Here I deſire not to be miſtaken, as if I ſhould ſay, how none that is a Papiſt can be ſaved, for God's Mercy is great and free, and when he pleaſes he can reveal his Truth to ſome
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41736:78"/>that now lie in the Ignorance and Blindneſs of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in Judgment, and Practice of that Church, ſo the good God may do to any <hi>Jew, Mahometan,</hi> or of any other wrong Perſwaſion whatſoever, as in Practice, to the repenting Thief; but I ſay, that a <hi>Papiſt</hi> dying in the Belief of thoſe effential Errors, God not imparting the Light of the Truth unto his Mind, and the Love of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Heart, ſuch an one, if God's Word ſpeaks Truth, ſhall not be ſaved: Why ſo? Becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath inſtituted ſeveral Ways of Salvation when Scripture ſpeaketh but of one, ſurely all but that muſt be wrong and falſe, ſo Chriſtian Religion owns but one only Saviour, namely, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Acts. 4.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there Savation in any other: For there is none other Name under Heaven given amongſt Men, whereby we must be ſaved,</hi> and as there is a Saviour and but one Saviour, ſo there is a Mediator and but one Mediator; <hi>there is one God and one Mediator</hi> (mark, as there is but one God, ſo there is but one Mediator, for in the Original the Word to expreſs <hi>one</hi> God, is the ſame to ſignifie <hi>one</hi> Mediator) <hi>the Man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now any one, though but little verſed with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, knows that they have other Mediators to truſt to, to intercede for them, whom they worſhip and pray to, as all their Saints, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the bleſſed Virgin, and theſe in a high Degree, as her <hi>Litany</hi> doth fully evidence, they attribute her a Power of commanding her Son the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Now as to their other Ways of Salvation, they are many, and by Vertue whereof they pretend to be juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as are good Works, Indulgencies of Popes,<note place="margin">See ſeaſonable Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion in 1689.</note> Treaſures of the Church, Merits of Saints, for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of one Saint or other, whoſe Protection they put themſelves under, they do much truſt to and depend upon. 'Tis true, they do not exclude the Merits of Chriſt, but they come in only in part and as Sharers,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41736:79"/>to what purpoſe this?<note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing Chriſt is able to ſave them to the utter moſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them,</hi> he alone hath ſatisfied God's Juſtice, and pacified his Wrath, <hi>I have trodden the Winepreſs alone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 63.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and of the People there was none with me,</hi> ſaith he by the Mouth of his prophet, neither Archangel or Angel, or any Creature in Heaven or in Earth being joyned with him in that Work, and can we think that after he alone hath endured the Torments of making Atonement for our Sins, he would leave with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Honour to have it applied throrough their Interceſſion.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> Now, <hi>he is the Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> take notice of both, Author and Finiſher of our Salvation, and of all things belonging thereunto, which is more clearly explained in that other Place, <hi>he became the Author of eternal Salvation unto all them that obey him,</hi> and he is alſo called <hi>the Captain of our Salvation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap 2.10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Again, I ſay they which for Salvation depend upon any other Sacrifice than that which Chriſt made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Croſs, may not upon any good Grounds hope for Salvation, becauſe no Promiſe for it in the Word, Scripture makes mention of none other but of that only: We ſhall be content with quoting ſome few Places all out of one Book of Scripture, where the Point of the Lord Chriſt's Prieſthood is of a ſet purpoſe, and fully treated of, and therein the pretended and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Sacrifice of the Maſs is condemned, which Point alone, if there was none other, is a ſufficient Cauſe for true Chriſtians to break off Communion with that Church,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.25, 26, 28.</note> 'tis in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often,</hi> ſpeaking of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>for then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the Foundation of the World.</hi> Hence we ſee how Chriſt was not often to offer himſelf: The Reaſon is, becauſe he was not often to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, wherefore they that would have him often offered, would have him alſo often to ſuffer, for whether he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41736:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>himſelf, or be offered by a Prieſt ſtill a Sufferer he muſt be: Now to ſhew how often this was to be, 'tis expreſſed and fixed, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>ſo Chriſt was once offered to bear the Sins of many;</hi> once and no more, and that's paſſed too, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was once offered, and it muſt be of a high Concernment for us to know it ought to have been but once, for Chap. 10. 'tis repeated twice, in <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>We are ſanctified thorough the Offering of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>But this Man Jeſus after he had offered one Sacrifice for Sins for ever,</hi> but one Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and that for ever; that is never to be reiterated any more, and <hi>v.</hi> 14. the Reaſon is given why there ought to be no more, becauſe there is no Neceſſity for it, <hi>for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why ſhould I trouble my ſelf any longer to inſiſt upon theſe eſſential and abominable Tenets and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is full of Errors in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of Idolatry and Superſtition in Worſhip: I hope no true Son of the Church can have the Face to deny the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be guilty of Idolatry, for they yield a religious Worſhip to the Creature, as to the Pope, whom after his Election, Cardinals do place upon the Altar, and there adore him for that's the Word to ſignifie the Homage which at that time they give him, then to the Virgin, to Saints, to Images, and to their Wafer-God, whereof they have Millions amongſt them. Now I ſay no more, only neither Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians nor Independents believe or do ſo, that is, that there is any other Mediator than the Lord Jeſus, that there are other Ways of Salvation than by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice he once made of himſelf upon the Croſs, neither do they practiſe any Idolatry as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, and we know for certain that no Idolaters ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:41736:80"/>
               <p>I hope theſe few things of many more I might have ſaid, will ſatisfie any impartial Reader, not blinded with Prejudice or with a violent Paſſion: As for thoſe that had rather to be Papiſts than Presbyterians, let them now with their Maſs in their Mouth, their other Saviour and Saints upon their Backs, with their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry about their Girdle, go home with Shame and hide themſelves, or rather amongſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> where they would be in their proper Place, and not amongſt us, for we can ſpare them well enough.</p>
